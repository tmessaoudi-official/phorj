# CLAUDE.md — phorj

> This file holds the RULES for how Claude delivers code here — quality, carefulness, gates.

> this to deliver correct code?* If not, it belongs in docs, not here.

Phorj is a statically-typed, PHP-inspired language implemented in Rust (edition 2021; core is
std-only with four vetted, feature-gated exceptions — `argon2`, `regex`, `ctrlc`, `corosensei` —
per `docs/specs/UNIFIED-SPEC.md` §"External dependency policy"): lexer → parser → type-checker → tree-walking
interpreter (the reference oracle) + bytecode compiler/stack VM + Phorj→PHP transpiler, plus a
PHP→Phorj lifter, LSP, formatter, test runner, and debugger. Single developer, commits direct to
`master`, remote is GitHub (`tmessaoudi-official/phorj`). The binary is `phg`; sources are `.phg`.

## Routing

This sub-project is handled with the global reasoning framework (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`). It is
NOT `/stack` infrastructure — never route work here to `global-stack-lead-dev`. The parent
`/stack/CLAUDE.md` is excluded via `/stack/projects/.claude/settings.json` `claudeMdExcludes`.

## Toolchain & quality gate

- `export PATH=/stack/tools/cargo/bin:$PATH`.
- **Green means ALL of:** `cargo test --workspace` + `cargo clippy --all-targets` +
  `cargo fmt --check` + `cargo build --release`, clean. Warnings fail the build
  (`[lints] warnings = "deny"`); `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` on both crate roots; toolchain pinned
  by `rust-toolchain.toml`. Tracked pre-commit hook: `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`.
- **Full correctness gate** (before claiming any feature done, and always before a push):
  `source scripts/toolchain.env && PHORJ_REQUIRE_PHP=1 cargo test --workspace` — the oracle php
  path lives in `scripts/toolchain.env` (the single editable knob; bump it there when the stack
  php version changes). With `PHORJ_REQUIRE_PHP=1` a missing `php` FAILS the oracle (never skips).
  Transpile floor = **PHP 8.5** (currently `php-8.5.8`); the bare `php` on PATH is 8.6-dev and too
  permissive — never gate against it (CI runs it only as a non-gating canary).
- **Perf:** `phg benchmark <file>` (median-of-N, output-identity gated) for before/after numbers;
  CI regression gate: `scripts/perf-gate.sh`.
- **After each shipped feature:** `cargo build --release` and report the binary path
  (`target/release/phg`) — standing developer rule.

## Git autonomy (overrides global Rule 10 — authorized by the developer, 2026-06-16)

Autonomous `git add` + `git commit` are **authorized**: stage and commit ready work without
asking, when the quality gate above is green. Limits:
- **Authorized:** `git add`, `git commit` — descriptive messages, `feat:`/`fix:`/`docs:`/`test:`
  prefixes matching history; no `Co-Authored-By` line.
- **NOT authorized without an explicit request:** `git push` (force-push stays denied globally).
- Commit only green, self-contained changes — never a broken build or red tests.
- If the safety classifier blocks a `git commit`, present the exact command for manual execution;
  do not retry or bypass.

## Delivery invariants (the rules — details in `docs/INVARIANTS.md`)

1. **Byte-identity spine.** `phg run` ≡ `phg runvm` ≡ transpiled PHP under a real `php` —
   identical stdout AND identical failure behaviour, for every program and every example.
   Enforced by `tests/differential.rs` (globs `examples/**/*.phg`, project-aware). Nothing is
   "done" until the full correctness gate above has run green. The ONE disclosed exception:
   concurrency (see rule 14 — its PHP leg is excluded, never silently degraded).
2. **The interpreter is the reference oracle.** When backends disagree, the interpreter is right
   by definition; validate the VM against it, never the reverse.
3. **A new `Op` variant extends three exhaustive matches in the same commit:** `vm::exec_op`
   (`src/vm/exec.rs`), `BytecodeProgram::validate` (`src/chunk.rs`), `compiler::stack_effect`
   (`src/compiler/mod.rs`). All three are wildcard-free — never reintroduce a `_` arm.
4. **Value kernels are single-sourced** in `src/value.rs` (checked int/float arithmetic,
   `compare_ord`, canonical fault strings). Never re-inline them in a backend; fault bodies are
   parity-affecting.
5. **Compile-time-only sugar is expanded OUT of the AST before any backend** (type aliases,
   generics erasure, html — all via the single `cli::check_and_expand` chokepoint). New sugar
   follows the same discipline: backends and the PHP output must never see it.
6. **Reified operands thread ALL vm-compile paths.** Anything that compiles for the VM
   (playground runvm, `disassemble`, `benchmark`, …) must go through
   `check_and_expand_reified` + `compile_with`, never plain `compile` — a miss hides run≠runvm
   off the differential's CLI path.
7. **CTy-operand trap (MUST-CHECK).** Un-rejecting an expression form, or adding one whose result
   can be an arithmetic operand, requires the compiler's `CTy` resolver to type it — and a
   differential case shaped `expr + 1`. Otherwise the VM rejects what the interpreter accepts.
8. **Mid-expression scratch slots (MUST-CHECK).** Ops that stash a receiver (`??`/`?.`/`!`-unwrap
   family) must use `self.height - 1`, not `locals.len() - 1`; any new such construct needs a
   differential case with TWO of them in one expression.
9. **Examples ship with features** (developer rule, definition-of-done): every shipped feature
   lands, in the same change, a runnable example under `examples/` (auto-gated by the
   differential glob) + an `examples/README.md` entry. CLI/tooling features get a walkthrough
   README + a small companion `.phg`. Faults can't be runnable examples — capture them in a
   README instead.
10. **Determinism.** `run`/`check`/`transpile` never touch the network (`phg vendor` is the only
    network command); examples use only deterministic inputs; any user-facing list derived from
    `HashMap`/`HashSet` iteration is sorted before rendering.
11. **No perf change without a measured before/after** from `phg benchmark` (and no perf claim
    above [Inferred] without one).
12. **Naming in code Claude writes:** packages/types/type-params PascalCase (`package Main;`,
    `Core.` reserved); functions/natives camelCase (`Output.printLine`); keyword `function`
    (never `fn`), return types `: T`, mandatory `new` for construction, explicit `this.field`.
    The naming SSOT is `docs/specs/UNIFIED-SPEC.md` §"Naming overhaul".
13. **File-size anti-regrowth** (ratified 2026-07-02): soft cap 800 lines / hard cap 1000 per
    source file; past the cap, split by cohesion into `foo/mod.rs` + sub-files (M-Decomp
    pattern, `pub(super)` for moved methods) — never by line count alone.
14. **THE LADDER RULE** (ratified 2026-07-02 — governs every feature with no PHP analog).
    When a feature has no faithful idiomatic PHP mapping, SURFACE it to the developer with a
    ladder analysis — never decide alone. Ladder: (1) faithful idiomatic PHP exists → transpile;
    (2) no faithful mapping → native-only: `E-TRANSPILE-<FEATURE>` hard error on transpile,
    differential-harness quarantine, and a disclosure paragraph wherever byte-identity is
    claimed; (3) silent semantic downgrade: FORBIDDEN. Every exclusion is a tracked, tested,
    register-recorded artifact. (First application: concurrency — hard error +
    explicit `--sequential-concurrency` opt-in with warning.)
15. **ADJUDICATION RULE** (ratified 2026-07-02 — governs design decisions). User-visible
    language/design decisions are the developer's, made interactively — an autonomous session
    records them as PENDING questions, never rules on them. Every design question ships with a
    minimal current-syntax failing program embedded IN the question text and the after-state in
    per-option previews (prose outside the question dialog is invisible to the developer while
    answering). Recommended option first, with the why.
