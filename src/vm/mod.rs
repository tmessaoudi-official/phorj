//! P1–P3: scalar arithmetic/negate/print/return (P1); the full `main`-only expression and

//! `run` returns a unified runtime `Diagnostic` (M2 P3.5 Wave 2 Task 2.1): the per-op `exec_op`
//! yields a bare fault body, and `run` attaches the source line from `Chunk.lines[ip]` so the

//! `"integer overflow"`, …) is preserved verbatim, keeping error parity with the interpreter
//! (the `agree_err` oracle classifies by body, tolerating the VM-only line prefix).
