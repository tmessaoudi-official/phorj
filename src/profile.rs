//! Build profiles (M-DX S0) — the `Dev` / `Release` gate that every environment-sensitive,
//! value-exposing, or diagnostic-verbosity feature keys off.
//!
//! # The keystone principle
//!
//! **A build profile may change diagnostics, observability, and side-channels ONLY — never observable
//! program behavior or output.** `interp ≡ VM ≡ real PHP` must hold *identically* under both `Dev`
//! and `Release`. Consequences:
//! - Assertions are always-checked; they are NOT stripped in `Release` (unlike C `NDEBUG`). A profile
//!   may only make a *failure diagnostic* terser, never remove a check (that would change control flow).
//! - No profile-conditional semantics (no "checked overflow in Dev, wrapping in Release").
//! - All value-exposing / observability output goes to **stderr**, outside the correctness spine.
//!
//! # How the profile is chosen (compile-time / entry-time, never a runtime env var)
//!
//! - `phg run` / `test` — the interactive developer tool — are **Dev** (the default).
//! - `phg serve` is **Release** unless `--dev` is passed (rich HTML fault pages leak traces/source,
//!   so they are Dev-only).
//! - `phg build` bakes the profile **into the artifact's container** (secure-by-construction):
//!   **Release by default**, `--dev` opt-in. A shipped binary therefore carries its own profile —
//!   no environment variable can flip a Release artifact into Dev at runtime.
//!
//! S0 establishes the type, threads it through `serve`, and bakes it into `phg build` artifacts.
//! The value-exposing consumers (value-dump S3, assertion richness S4, the debugger S5) read
//! [`active`] and are gated to `Dev`.
