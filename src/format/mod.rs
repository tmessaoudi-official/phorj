//! `phg format` — the canonical-form source formatter (GA rock 2 tooling). A full-surface,
//! comment-preserving AST printer (`printer`) plus the `format` entry that lexes → parses → prints.
//!
//! The formatter's one hard rule is **meaning preservation**: it prints from the parsed AST (not by
//! re-spacing tokens), so `parse(fmt(x)) ≡ parse(x)` holds by construction, and the printer's matches
//! are exhaustive so it can never silently mis-handle a node. It is also **idempotent**
//! (`fmt(fmt(x)) == fmt(x)`) and **never touches an unparseable file** (a parse error is returned, the
//! source left alone).
