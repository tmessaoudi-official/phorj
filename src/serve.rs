//! M6 W3 — HTTP serve runtime. The ONE place sockets + wall-clock non-determinism live, kept
//! deliberately OUTSIDE the byte-identity spine: `tests/differential.rs` never imports this module —
//! its conformance is covered by `tests/serve.rs` over a deterministic in-memory [`Transport`].
//!
//! The portable unit stays `handle(Request) -> Response` (W1) *inside* the served program; the
//! runtime only shuttles raw bytes to a single Phorj entry **`respond(bytes) -> bytes`** ([`SERVE_ENTRY`])
//! and writes the result back. HTTP/1.1 with **keep-alive** (S4.1) when a `--timeout` is configured —
//! a connection is reused until `Connection: close`, the per-connection cap, or the idle timeout; with
//! no timeout it is one request per connection (the idle-socket guard).
//!
//! Concurrency (M6 W3): a bounded OS-thread pool, **one request per worker thread, each with its own
//! `Rc` `Value` heap** — values never cross threads, so the non-`Send` heap is no obstacle (the
//! `ast::Program` shared across workers IS `Send + Sync`). `--workers N` (default = CPU cores);
//! `--workers 1` keeps the original single-threaded path. This supersedes the old "green-threads"
//! plan (which would have been single-core + needs unstable/unsafe std machinery) — see
//! `docs/specs/2026-06-28-m6-w3-serve-concurrency-design.md`.
