//! S4.3 step-3 GATING SPIKE — prove the coroutine suspension model the tree-walking interpreter needs
//! works in phorj's own unsafe-free code (`#![deny(unsafe_code)]` roots). The crux (design §4): a deeply-recursive evaluator
//! must `suspend` from far down its call stack. corosensei's `Yielder` is only handed to the coroutine
//! closure, so to reach it deep in the recursion we borrow it into a lifetime-parameterized worker
//! struct created *inside* the closure (the closure is `'static`, but locals inside it may borrow the
//! yielder arg). No `unsafe` in our crate; no threading the yielder through every method signature.
//!
//! This module is compiled only with the `green` feature on a non-wasm target, and only `cfg(test)`
//! exercises it — it is a feasibility probe, deleted once the real executor (step 3b) lands.

#![cfg(all(feature = "green", not(target_arch = "wasm32"), test))]
