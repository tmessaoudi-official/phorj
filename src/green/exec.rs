//! The cooperative green-thread **executor loop** (M6 W4 / S4.3 step 3b) — engine-agnostic.
//!
//! [`sched::Scheduler`](super::sched::Scheduler) decides *which* task runs next; this module is the
//! loop that actually *drives* tasks and threads their output + results together. It is parameterized
//! over a [`Task`] trait so it can be unit-tested with a mock executor here, then driven by the real
//! per-backend executors (interpreter coroutine / VM frame-swap) without changing this coordination
//! logic — the same "single-sourced, backend-agnostic" discipline as the scheduler kernel.
//!
//! **Output ordering (the key invariant).** A task produces output as it runs, but only becomes
//! visible to the loop when it *suspends* (or completes). Between two suspension points a task runs
//! contiguously, so the output it produced in that slice is one contiguous fragment. Each `resume`
//! returns that fragment ([`Step`]); the loop appends fragments in resume order, which reconstructs
//! the correct interleaved output **without** any shared output buffer — so the per-task engines keep
//! their own `out: String` unchanged. This is what makes `run≡runvm` byte-identical: both backends
//! drive this same loop with the same scheduler, so fragments are appended in the same order.
//!
//! **Determinism.** The loop takes the next ready task from the FIFO scheduler, drains newly-spawned
//! tasks in spawn order, and appends output in resume order — no wall-clock, no nondeterminism.
