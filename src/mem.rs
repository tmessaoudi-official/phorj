//! Process memory sampling for `phorge bench`. std-only and Linux-only: it reads
//! `/proc/self/status` (`VmRSS` = current resident set, `VmHWM` = peak resident set) and resets the
//! kernel's peak high-water mark through `/proc/self/clear_refs`. Every function returns an
//! `Option` (or is a silent no-op) when `/proc` is unavailable — non-Linux hosts, sandboxes, the
//! cross-built Windows/macOS binaries — so `bench` reports "memory: unavailable on this platform"
//! rather than failing. No crates, no `unsafe`: just a file read and a file write (EV-7 spirit —
//! a missing or malformed `/proc` entry yields `None`, never a panic).
