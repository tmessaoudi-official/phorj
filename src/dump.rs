//! Value-dump on fault (M-DX S3) — an opt-in, Dev-only post-mortem. When a runtime fault occurs and
//! dumping is enabled, the interpreter snapshots the faulting frame's locals and renders them (via the
//! secure [`crate::inspect`] renderer) into the fault [`Diagnostic`]'s `dump` section, printed to
//! stderr after the stack trace. Deep at the fault (locals), shallow elsewhere (the backtrace is just
//! function + line).
//!
//! # Security posture
//!
//! - **Opt-in even in Dev.** Off by default; enabled only by `--dump-on-fault`.
//! - **Never in Release.** [`should_dump`] additionally requires the Dev profile
//!   ([`crate::profile::active`]), so a Release artifact never emits locals regardless of the flag.
//! - **Secret-safe + bounded.** Rendering goes through [`crate::inspect`], which redacts `Secret<T>`
//!   and caps depth/size.
//! - **Side-channel only.** The dump is appended to the stderr fault render; it never touches stdout,
//!   so it is outside the `run ≡ runvm ≡ PHP` correctness spine.
//!
//! # Backend scope
//!
//! Rich named locals are produced on the **interpreter**, which holds live `name → Value` scopes at
//! fault time. The VM stores slot-indexed locals with no name mapping, so a byte-identical *named*
//! dump would need a per-scope debug-symbol table — deliberately not built, mirroring the debugger
//! (S5), which is interpreter-only for the same reason: the spine guarantees `run ≡ runvm ≡ PHP`, so
//! a dump taken on the interpreter provably reflects the VM's state. The stack-trace backtrace is
//! byte-identical on both backends (error-handling slice 1).
