# Web examples — the M6 HTTP story

Phorj's web model is **`handle(Request) -> Response` at the value level** (PSR-7/15 shaped). The
request/response types and the parse/route/serialize logic are **pure Phorj**, byte-identity-gated
on `run` / `runvm` like every other example. Two thin, untranspiled runtimes carry those bytes over
a real socket — one native, one PHP — and both call the *same* `handle`.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `handler.phg` | **W1** — the handler model: `Request`/`Response` classes, `parseRequest(bytes) -> Request?`, `serializeResponse(Response) -> bytes`, `handle(Request) -> Response`. Bodies are `bytes`; headers are raw `List<string>` lines behind `req.header(name)`. No socket. |
| `router.phg` | **W2** — a static exact-match router: a `List<Route>` table + linear `(method, path)` scan → a `Handler` enum tag → exhaustive `match` dispatch. Pure Phorj, no new language feature. |
| `server.phg` | **W4** — the full served app: W1 parse/serialize + W2 routing + the single entry `respond(bytes) -> bytes`. This is what `phg serve` runs. |
| `password-verify.phg` | **`Core.Cryptography`** — verify a password against a committed Argon2id PHC hash. Deterministic ⇒ byte-identity-gated; the non-deterministic `hashPassword` is documented below. |

## `Core.Cryptography` — password hashing (Argon2id)

Secure password hashing follows the one inviolable rule — **never roll your own crypto**. Phorj
implements it natively on the Rust backends via the audited RustCrypto **`argon2`** crate (the sole
external dependency, admitted under `docs/specs/2026-06-27-dependency-policy.md`); the transpile
bridge emits PHP's `password_hash`/`password_verify` as a *peer* target. Both speak the standard PHC
string (`$argon2id$…`), so **a hash made by either backend verifies in the other**.

```phorj
package Main;
import Core.Output;
import Core.Cryptography;

function main(): void {
    // hashPassword uses a fresh random salt → a different string every call (this is correct).
    string hash = Cryptography.hashPassword("correct horse battery staple");
    Output.printLine(hash); // e.g. $argon2id$v=19$m=...$.../...

    // Verify is deterministic for a fixed (password, hash) pair.
    Output.printLine("{Cryptography.verifyPassword(\"correct horse battery staple\", hash)}"); // true
    Output.printLine("{Cryptography.verifyPassword(\"wrong\", hash)}");                        // false
}
```

- **`Cryptography.hashPassword(password: string) -> string`** — Argon2id over a random salt; returns the PHC
  string. **Non-deterministic** (random salt) ⇒ it is *quarantined* from the byte-identity oracle and
  has no runnable gated example (its output differs every run by design); it is covered by
  `tests/crypto.rs` instead.
- **`Cryptography.verifyPassword(password: string, hash: string) -> bool`** — constant-time verify; a
  malformed hash is `false`, never a fault. Deterministic ⇒ `password-verify.phg` gates it 3-way.
- **Salt is internal.** You don't manage a salt (unlike a raw KDF) — Argon2id embeds it in the PHC
  string, and `verifyPassword` reads it back. Rotate cost params by re-hashing on next login.
| `server.php` | **W4** — the PHP front-controller bridge: builds a `Request` from PHP superglobals, calls the transpiled `handle`, emits the `Response`. Runnable under `php -S`. |
| `json-api.phg` | **`Core.Json` + the handler model** — a JSON endpoint: POST a JSON array of ints to get `{"count": N, "sum": S}`; a non-array body or malformed JSON returns `400` with a JSON `{"error": …}`. Bodies are JSON-in-`bytes`; `handle` parses with `Core.Json.parse`, branches with `match`, and answers with `Core.Json.stringify`. Pure value-in/value-out, byte-identical run/runvm/real PHP. |

## Run it natively — `phg serve`

`server.phg` defines `respond(bytes) -> bytes`. `phg serve` binds a socket, frames each HTTP/1.1
request, calls `respond` once per request, and writes the bytes back. All HTTP logic — parsing,
routing, the 400-on-malformed — lives in `respond`, in pure Phorj; the runtime (`src/serve.rs`) is
the thinnest possible glue and knows nothing about the `Request`/`Response` layout.

**HTTP/1.1 keep-alive (M6 W4 / S4.1):** with a `--timeout` set, a connection is reused for multiple
requests (every response carries `Content-Length`, so it is self-delimiting) until the client sends
`Connection: close`, the per-connection cap (100) is reached, or the idle read-timeout fires. The
timeout is the idle-socket guard: **without `--timeout`, keep-alive is off** and each connection
serves one request then closes (so an idle client can never pin the single-threaded server or a pool
worker). Both the single-threaded path and the `--workers N` pool keep connections alive.

**Graceful shutdown (M6 W4 / S4.2):** `Ctrl-C` (SIGINT) or SIGTERM stops the server accepting new
connections, lets in-flight requests finish, joins the worker pool, and exits `0` — no request is cut
mid-flight. (A second `Ctrl-C` while draining hard-kills.) This needs the `signals` build feature
(on by default; off only for the WASM playground, which has no sockets).

```console
$ phg serve examples/web/server.phg --addr 127.0.0.1:8080
phg serve: listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080

$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8080/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 17
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/plain

Phorj web — home

$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/greet -H 'Host: phorj.dev'
Hello phorj.dev
$ curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:8080/missing
404
```

The server is **single-threaded by design**: the `Rc`-shared object heap makes runtime values
non-`Send`, so a thread pool is impossible; true concurrency arrives with M6 green-threads under
this *unchanged* `handle(Request) -> Response` contract.

`server.phg` also has a `main()` that exercises `respond` on canned `b"…"` requests, so the program
stays byte-identical on `run` / `runvm` (and through real PHP) — the socket path is the only part
not covered there. That path is covered by `tests/serve.rs`, deliberately **outside** the
byte-identity spine (the determinism quarantine).

## Run it on PHP — `php -S`

The same program transpiles to idiomatic PHP. `server.php` is a hand-written front-controller (the
superglobal↔`Request` adapter is runtime glue, not transpiled — exactly like `src/serve.rs` on the
native side) that calls the transpiled `handle`. Generate the handlers next to it (dropping the demo
`main()` bootstrap), then start PHP's built-in server:

```console
$ phg transpile examples/web/server.phg | sed '$d' > examples/web/web_app.php
$ php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 examples/web/server.php

$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/greet -H 'Host: phorj.dev'
Hello phorj.dev
```

`web_app.php` is a generated artifact — regenerate it from `server.phg`; it is not committed.

## Why this shape

- **One value contract, two engines.** `handle(Request) -> Response` is the portable unit. `phg
  serve` and `php -S` are interchangeable hosts for it; the byte path is identical because the
  Phorj backends are byte-identical and PHP round-trips the same logic.
- **Determinism stays intact.** Everything testable (parse, route, serialize) is pure Phorj, gated
  on `run ≡ runvm`. The non-deterministic socket is one quarantined module checked over an in-memory
  transport — it never touches `tests/differential.rs`.

## Deferred (Track A / later M6)

Path parameters (`/users/{id}`) and middleware/closure routes gate on later features
(parallel-list-iteration / generics for segment matching; lambdas for middleware). The
`handle(Request) -> Response` contract does **not** change when they land — they layer on top of the
exact-match core shown here.

**Drop the `respond` bridge (gated on `Core.Http`).** Today each app writes the same
`respond(bytes) -> bytes` glue — parse → `handle` → serialize, with a `400`-on-malformed fallback.
That boilerplate is identical everywhere, but it can't be synthesized by the runtime yet because the
`Request`/`Response` types and the parse/serialize/error policy are still defined per-app (and baking
that policy into Rust would break the determinism layering). Once a standard **`Core.Http`** module
ships `Request`/`Response` + `parseRequest`/`serializeResponse`, `phg serve` will run a bare
`handle(Request) -> Response` directly — the `respond` shim disappears, the contract is unchanged.
`Core.Http` is tracked with the native-stdlib wave.
