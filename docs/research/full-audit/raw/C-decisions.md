## 1. Foundational doctrine & process

| ID | Date | Decision | Alternatives rejected | Source | Mode | Shipped |
|----|------|----------|----------------------|--------|------|---------|
| DEC-001 | 06-15 | Three-backend model: tree-walking interpreter + bytecode VM + Phorj→PHP transpiler, gated by a byte-identity differential spine (`run ≡ runvm`) | single backend | specs/2026-06-15-phorj-language-design.md, m2-bytecode-vm-design.md | ASKED | ✅ |
| DEC-002 | 06-17/18 | Transpile contract **D-L9**: Phorj : PHP :: TypeScript : JavaScript — every feature maps to idiomatic PHP; PHP-absent features compile-time-only + erased | features w/o a PHP target | specs/2026-06-17-m3-language-roadmap-design.md | ASKED | ✅ |
| DEC-003 | 06-19 | M7 PHP oracle in the loop: transpiled PHP executed under real `php` must match interpreter stdout; `PHORJ_REQUIRE_PHP=1` fails-not-skips | skip-when-missing | plans/2026-06-19-m7-correctness-closure.plan.md; memory php-leg-outside-correctness-loop | ASKED | ✅ |
| DEC-004 | 06-21 | **Philosophy locked**: craftsmanship (SOLID/patterns/best practice) is the APEX filter — not familiarity, not purism; PHP is the floor, never the ceiling; additive power, never remove capability | familiarity-first; PL-theory purism (both explicitly corrected) | memory philosophy-of-phorge; parity SSOT §1 | ASKED (dev corrected Claude twice) | ✅ doctrine |
| DEC-005 | 06-27 | **Transpile is a bridge, not a runtime**: every feature/native implemented natively on Rust backends; PHP emission is a peer target, never the source of truth; never delegate a capability to PHP | PHP-only implementations (Claude proposed twice, rejected) | memory transpile-is-a-bridge-not-a-runtime | ASKED (hard feedback) | ✅ doctrine |
| DEC-006 | 06-24 | **Language config must be compile-time** (phorj.toml `[language]` / editions → M13); runtime knobs (env/.ini) architecturally rejected — transpiled PHP runs with no Phorj runtime, would silently break byte-identity in prod | runtime env/.ini flag | plans/2026-06-24-language-evolution-master.plan.md; memory config-must-be-compile-time | ASKED | ✅ doctrine (M13 📐) |
| DEC-007 | 06-26 | **Determinism Partition**: every capability is Tier A (pure/deterministic → byte-identity-gated) or Tier B (impure → quarantined via Transport model, fixture-tested); admission decided CASE-BY-CASE, no blanket Tier-B charter | blanket Tier-B charter (dev's own round-1 lean, withdrawn post-challenge) | plans/2026-06-26-native-modules-research.plan.md + extended-scope.plan.md | ASKED | ✅ |
| DEC-008 | 06-26 | Zero-dependency std-only core ("NO TLS, NO regex, NO http/serde crates") as locked framing | — | plans/2026-06-26-native-modules-research.plan.md | ASKED | ⬆ superseded by DEC-009 (see CONFLICTS C-3) |
| DEC-009 | 06-27→29 | **Dependency policy**: narrowly-scoped vetted external deps admitted per-domain — argon2 (crypto), regex (ReDoS-immune matching), ctrlc (signals), corosensei (coroutines); all optional/feature-gated, playground stays dep-free | hand-rolled crypto/regex/unsafe; general-purpose deps (tokio et al. stay disallowed) | specs/2026-06-27-dependency-policy.md; Cargo.toml comments | ASKED (each dep individually authorized) | ✅ |
| DEC-010 | 06-21 | **Autonomy contract**: TOTAL autonomy incl. big architecture, stop+ask only on genuine craftsmanship forks; auto-commit green slices; NEVER push | per-slice checkpoints | memory ga-direction-and-autonomy | ASKED | ✅ standing |
| DEC-011 | 06-17 | **Examples ship with features** (standing rule): every feature lands with a byte-identity-gated `examples/` program + README entry in the same change | retroactive examples | memory examples-ship-with-features; CLAUDE.md | ASKED | ✅ standing |
| DEC-012 | 06-25 | Overnight-session fork protocol: genuine forks logged with provisional call + `⏳ AWAITING CONFIRMATION`, never decided silently; walked next morning | silent autonomous decisions | plans/2026-06-25-overnight-autonomous-session.plan.md | ASKED | ✅ process |
| DEC-013 | 06-28 | **Rename Phorge → Phorj** (reads "forge"; Phorge = active Phabricator fork, SEO/legal collision); `phg` binary + `.phg` extension kept | Clarus/Hone/Hearth/… shortlist; fire-theme names (all collide); keep Phorge | memory name-collision-rename-decision | ASKED | ✅ code (`297229f`); GitHub repo rename + dir `mv` still manual |
| DEC-014 | 06-18 | CLI binary renamed `phorj` → `phg` (ripgrep model: package/lib/env-vars stay `phorj`… then-`phorge`) | — | CLAUDE.md (`70ea75d`); memory binary-renamed-to-phg | ASKED | ✅ |

| DEC-016 | 07-01 | Full-audit shape: audit-first NO code; every recorded decision adjudicated interactively (AskUserQuestion, batches of 4); "100% of the language" = everything ever mentioned, no cutline; CLAUDE.md full rewrite rules-only | — | plans/2026-07-01-full-audit-and-master-plan.plan.md | ASKED | in progress (this register) |

| DEC-021 | 06-18 | **Go-style module-qualified calls** (leaf-qualified: root in the import, leaf at the call site) | Java `System.out.println` object-path (no idiomatic PHP target, breaks D-L9); 3-segment full paths | same | ASKED | ✅ |
| DEC-022 | 06-18 | Reserved `core.` stdlib root; jargon-free leaves `console` (not io), `file` (not fs), `text` (not string — "avoids shadowing the `string` type") | io/fs/string names | same | ASKED | ⬆ leaves renamed twice (DEC-034, DEC-113; see CONFLICTS C-4) |

| DEC-026 | 06-18 | Native registry keyed by `(module, name)`; one `Op::CallNative(idx, argc)`; `Op::Print` retired; shared `eval` = structural parity (one impl, two callers) | per-native Ops; two print mechanisms | plans/2026-06-18-trackB-stdlib-io-imports.md | ASKED | ✅ |
| DEC-027 | 06-18 | `E-SHADOW-IMPORT`: a value binding may not shadow an imported qualifier (keeps locals-first run-backends and import-map transpiler consistent) | — | same; memory namespace-system-decisions | AUTONOMOUS (impl detail) | ✅ |
| DEC-028 | 06-18 | Manifest = **Composer vocabulary in an honest TOML** (`phorj.toml`, `[require]`, `vendor/package` names); literal `composer.json` REJECTED (a file the composer tool can't process is a false promise); **exact-pin only**, no `^`/`~` ranges | composer.json; version ranges + resolver | plans/2026-06-18-m5-modules-packages.md | ASKED (dev's own kill-shot) | ✅ |
| DEC-029 | 06-18 | Directory=package, strict folder=path (`E-PKG-PATH`), enforcement path-aware in the **loader**, never in `check()`; flat AST merge | enforcement in checker | same | ASKED | ✅ |
| DEC-030 | 06-18 | Cross-package resolution = **loader-side name-mangling to PHP FQNs** before any backend (backends consume rewritten AST unchanged → run≡runvm structural) | backend-aware resolution | same (S2c) | ASKED | ✅ |
| DEC-031 | 06-18 | PHP emission = **single-file brace-namespace blocks** + `\Main\main()` bootstrap | PSR-4 dir tree + Composer autoload (can't autoload free functions; Phorj is function-heavy) | specs/2026-06-18-m5-project-model-design.md; selective-type-import spec | ASKED | ✅ |
| DEC-032 | 06-18 | Library packages export **functions only** (`E-PKG-TYPE`) — interim scope | — | plans (S2c) | ASKED | ⬆ lifted by DEC-036 (planned supersession) |
| DEC-033 | 06-18 | M5 S3: git deps + `phorj.lock` (SHA pin + FNV-1a-64 tree hash) + `phg vendor` = the ONLY network-touching command; run/check/transpile offline-only (`E-VENDOR-MISSING`); guards `E-DUP-DEF`, `E-VENDOR-MAIN` | live fetch on run | plans/2026-06-18-m5-modules-packages.md | ASKED (design 3C-converged) | ✅ (transitive deps deferred) |
| DEC-034 | 06-20 | Stdlib root + leaves become **PascalCase** (`Core.Console`, `Core.Text`…; fn names stay camelCase) | lowercase `core.*` | plans/2026-06-20-m-rt-rich-types.plan.md ("even native core should be PascalCase") | ASKED | ✅ (`c4479d6`) |
| DEC-035 | 06-20 | **Casing is a HARD ERROR for all**: package/folder segments PascalCase (`E-PKG-CASE`), types PascalCase, fns/vars camelCase; no `W-CASE` lint fallback; manifest key `name` → `module`; PascalCase enforced incl. vendor (PHP deps case-mapped at importer boundary) | warn-only lint | plans/2026-06-20-post-wave3-four-tracks.plan.md; parity write-back | ASKED | ✅ (`15a5745`+) |
| DEC-036 | 06-20 | E-PKG-TYPE **lifted**: library packages may declare class/enum/interface, consumed via terminal **`import type Pkg.Path.Type [as A];`**; all three kinds in one commit; codes `E-TYPE-IMPORT-*` | classes-first phasing; module-qualified `Geometry.Point` form (deferred) | specs/2026-06-20-epkgtype-lift-crosspackage-types-design.md | ASKED ("all three at once") | ✅ |

| DEC-047 | 07-01 | **No-wind closure** (design-locked, NOT implemented): fault intrinsics `panic/todo/unreachable/assert` move behind mandatory `import Core;`, called `Core.assert(...)` etc. (`E-UNIMPORTED`); deep imports `import Core.A.B.C` any depth binding bare leaf AND parent-qualified; aliasing extended to stdlib+deep; de-reserve `Attr`→Core.Html, `Error`→Core.Error, `Channel`/`Task`→**`Core.Async`** (dev rejected "Concurrent" as misnomer — tasks are cooperative, never parallel) | keep intrinsics in the wind; `Core.Concurrent` | specs/2026-07-01-no-wind-namespace-and-language-surface-design.md | ASKED | 📐 |

| ID | Date | Decision | Alternatives rejected | Source | Mode | Shipped |
|----|------|----------|----------------------|--------|------|---------|
| DEC-050 | 06-20 | M-RT scope = **maximal TS-grade type system** (interfaces, instanceof, unions, intersections, erased generics, inheritance, Map/Set, traits) | "coherent cluster only"; defer (Claude's recs, overruled — "put a real effort here") | plans/2026-06-20-m-rt-rich-types.plan.md | ASKED | ✅ (M-RT CLOSED 06-23) |
| DEC-051 | 06-20 | Keyword **`instanceof`** (lowercase, PHP-style); the broken `is` value-equality stub replaced by a real type test with smart-cast narrowing; `is` no longer a keyword | keep `is` as type-test keyword; Claude's dissent to RETIRE `is` entirely (recorded non-binding; dev chose Option 1) | same + plans/2026-06-20-post-wave3-four-tracks.plan.md | ASKED | ✅ |
| DEC-052 | 06-20 | Interfaces: nominal subtyping via one shared `ast::class_implements` consumed by checker+interpreter+VM; `package Main`-only that slice; exact sig match | per-backend duplication | m-rt plan (S2 design) | AUTONOMOUS (impl, inside approved slice) | ✅ |
| DEC-053 | 06-20 | Generics = **fully erased** (no monomorphization), reified-in-checker; call-site first-binding-wins `unify`; `Type::Erased` rewritten pre-backend at the `check_and_expand` chokepoint | monomorphization | m-rt plan (S7a) | ASKED (approach) / AUTONOMOUS (details) | ✅ |
| DEC-054 | 06-20 | **Generics reach = ALL** — free fns + methods + classes + (later) enums | free-functions-only | m-rt plan ("I want generics all options") | ASKED | ✅ |

| DEC-056 | 06-20 | S4 unions: **D1 primitive members allowed** (`int\|string`); **D2 one big S4** (unions + match-over-union together); **D3 fully autonomous**; `Pattern::Type` reuses `Op::IsInstance`; lone `Circle =>` stays a catch-all binding (footgun deliberately preserved) | enum members (deferred); S4a-only split | specs/2026-06-20-s4-union-types-design.md | ASKED (D1–D3) / AUTONOMOUS (details incl. footgun) | ✅ |
| DEC-057 | 06-21 | S5 intersections: **D1 = ≤1 concrete class + N interfaces** (dev overruled Claude's interface-only rec — correctly); `E-INTERSECT-MULTI-CLASS` for ≥2 classes; **D2 = require-agreement `E-INTERSECT-SIG`** (revisit when overloading lands) | interface-only members; first-member-wins conflict rule | m-rt plan; specs/2026-06-20-s5-intersection-types-design.md | ASKED (2 challenge rounds) | ✅ (D2 revisit still open — see CONFLICTS C-8) |
| DEC-058 | 06-21/22 | **Method overloading confirmed** (dev explicitly rejected "stay PHP-aligned / don't add it": "this language should be equal or better than PHP"); lowers to ONE dispatching PHP method; compile-time unambiguous, most-specific-wins, `T?`≠`T` | no overloading (PHP parity) | m-rt plan; memory ga-direction-and-autonomy | ASKED | ✅ |

| DEC-068 | 06-22 | **Error model = three tiers**: enforced typed `throws E` (PHP-familiar default; specific type required) + `Result<T,E>` value surface + unchecked faults/panics for bugs; `try/catch` discharges `throws` + PHP-interop bridge | Result-first-only (Claude's rec); Java checked-everything | parity SSOT §2.1; plans/2026-06-21-roadmap-completeness-review.plan.md | ASKED (dev extended the rec; reconciled via challenge) | ✅ (slice 2 closed; 3 new Ops) |

## 10. Parity SSOT (2026-06-21/22) — verdict summary

**One-shot 20-track (A–S+V), 41-agent review → 555 deduplicated candidates: 290 adopt / 187 defer / 81
reject.** SSOT: `docs/specs/2026-06-21-php-parity-and-beyond.md`. Verdict vocabulary: kind
port/new/map/omit × rec adopt/defer/reject. Category sections: 2.1 error handling/totality · 2.2 OO &
types · 2.3 pattern matching · 2.4 call convention/operators/syntax · 2.5 semantics/numerics · 2.6
mutation/build/packages · 2.7 stdlib & batteries · 2.8 concurrency/web/security · 2.9 tooling/testing/DX ·
2.10 performance · 2.11 interop & migration · 2.12 docs/governance/competitive.

Developer-locked batch decisions from the triage (already itemized above where major): three-tier error
model (DEC-068); totality-before-overloading reorder (DEC-060); nine new milestones approved (M4, M-NUM,
M-TIME, M-text, M-Test, M-perf, M-Batteries, M8.5, M13); full ROADMAP/MILESTONES write-back; PascalCase
incl. vendor (DEC-035). Representative REJECT bucket (81): single-quote strings, `<=>`, `.` concat,
`switch`, ambient superglobals, `eval`, variable-variables, runtime magic methods (`__get`/`__set`/`__call`),
loose `==` semantics, `@` suppression, PL-theory items that don't earn their surprise budget (typestate,
refinement types, comptime macros noted as vanity for this language's thesis). An earlier version of the
review had a ~56-item purist reject bucket that the developer **corrected** (philosophy recalibration —
see DEC-004); verdicts were re-graded under the craftsmanship-apex lens.

## CONFLICTS (contradictory records — adjudicate)

| # | Conflict | Trace | Status |
|---|----------|-------|--------|
| **C-1** | **D-L3 (06-18) REJECTED multiple inheritance** ("realized as traits/mixins + interfaces") — yet **S6 shipped real MI** (`class C extends A, B`) *and* S8 shipped traits. | Traced: 06-18 D-L3 reject (next-intuitive-features spec) → 06-21 dev: "multi-inheritance wanted, real game changer, WITHOUT removing traits" (ga-direction memory) → 06-22 dev rejected the single+traits framing **twice**, demanded research → S6 Model-1 explicit-resolution MI ASKED + shipped; Model-3 C3 deferred. So: a legitimate developer reversal, properly recorded each step — but **D-L3's text was never amended**, so the two specs still contradict. | Developer-driven supersession; needs doc reconciliation, not re-adjudication. |
| **C-2** | **A-6 (06-25) adopted `foreach (coll as …)` to REPLACE `for (x in coll)`** ("free `for` for C-style only") — but commit `0747385` (06-26) shipped foreach **"alongside the typed `for (T x in xs)` form"**; examples still use for-in everywhere; FEATURES.md lists `for … in` ✅ with no replacement note; B1 (06-30) *extended* for-in (string/Map two-binding). | The decided replacement was silently softened into an addition during an autonomous slice. Either the decision or the implementation is wrong. [Verified: both forms parse today.] | **Open — adjudicate** (keep both / execute the replacement / amend A-6). |
| **C-3** | **Zero-dep locked framing (06-26): "NO TLS, NO regex, NO http/serde crates, `[dependencies]` empty, verified"** — days later `regex` admitted as dep #2, plus argon2/ctrlc/corosensei (4 deps total). | Each dep individually developer-authorized under the 06-27 dependency policy; but the 06-26 "LOCKED FRAMING" text (native-modules-research plan) explicitly names regex as forbidden and was never updated. | Superseded-in-practice; framing doc stale. |
| **C-4** | **`text` leaf chosen 06-18 explicitly "not `string` (avoids shadowing the `string` type)"** — naming overhaul (06-30) renamed `Core.Text` → **`Core.String`**. | The original rationale (shadowing) is mooted by PascalCase (`String` ≠ `string`), but no record shows the old rationale being revisited when the rename was made. | Likely fine; confirm the shadowing concern was consciously dismissed. |
| **C-5** | **Ternary: two same-day records disagree (06-24)** — perimeter spec says "ternary ✅ add"; master plan says "DEFERRED, not rejected" (postfix-`?` collision + expression-if coverage). | [Verified: `? :` is a parse error in the current binary → DEFERRED won.] The perimeter spec was never corrected. | Resolved in practice; fix the stale record. |
| **C-6** | **M6 design (06-18): OS-thread pools "off the table"** (Rc heap) — yet **M6 W3 shipped an OS-thread pool for `phg serve`** (memory: m6-w3-serve-concurrency), later superseded by green threads. | The W3 pool isolated per-connection state so it didn't share `Value`s, but it contradicts the design's blanket statement; superseded anyway by DEC-132. | Historical; no action beyond doc note. |
| **C-7** | **CLAUDE.md/docs still document `phg bench`, `phg disasm`, `phg fmt`** while DEC-113 renamed the CLI verbs to `benchmark`/`disassemble`/`format`/`tokenize`. | Doc drift from the unpushed naming overhaul; e.g. project CLAUDE.md instructs `phg bench <file>`. | Doc reconciliation task. |
| **C-8** | **`E-INTERSECT-SIG` (require-agreement) was decided with "revisited when overloading lands"** — overloading landed (param + return-type); no record shows the revisit happening. | m-rt plan D2 note vs overloading completion. | **Open — adjudicate** (allow intersections whose shared method differs per overloading rules?). |
| **C-9** | **"Nothing in the wind" (06-18) vs shipped import-free intrinsics** — `panic`/`todo`/`unreachable`/`assert` shipped usable with no import, violating the standing principle for weeks. | Caught by the developer 07-01; fix designed (DEC-047: `import Core;`) but NOT implemented. | Designed fix pending implementation. |
| **C-10** | **Zero-payload enum-variant construction guidance is stale in older records** — pre-06-24 docs/memory said "construct with `V()`"; mandatory-`new` (DEC-083) made it `new V()`, while *match patterns* still use bare call form `V()` (bare `V =>` remains a silent catch-all footgun, deliberately preserved in DEC-056). | memory zero-payload-variant-call-form (already corrected 07-01) + S4 footgun preservation. | Mostly reconciled; the `V =>` catch-all footgun itself may deserve re-adjudication (it was preserved autonomously). |

## AUTONOMOUS-HIGH-IMPACT (adjudicate first)

Ranked by user-visible blast radius (syntax/keywords/semantics). All were made in `_AUTONOMOUS_3C` /
bypass-sentinel sessions without a per-decision ask; some sit inside developer-approved *milestones* but
the specific user-visible call was Claude's.

1. **DEC-056(d) — the `Circle =>` catch-all footgun deliberately preserved** (S4, autonomous D3): a bare
   PascalCase ident in a match arm is a *binding*, silently catching everything; the type-pattern needs
   two idents. This is the same trap that already bit zero-payload enum variants. A one-line warning
   (`W-BINDING-SHADOWS-TYPE`) was possible and was not chosen. **Highest silent-bug surface.**
2. **DEC-094 execution drift — foreach shipped "alongside" instead of "replacing" for-in** (C-2): the
   language now permanently carries TWO iteration statements; every doc/example choice compounds it.
   Decided-ASKED, drifted-AUTONOMOUS.
3. **Totality cluster semantics (DEC-060)**: `E-MISSING-RETURN` hard error + `never` type + the exact
   divergence rules (`while(true)` with no `break` counts, etc.) — a breaking-ish soundness gate whose
   precise contours (what counts as terminating) were fixed autonomously.
4. **Pattern-cluster surface (06-23, fully autonomous)**: `when` guard keyword (contextual), struct
   destructuring forms (shorthand/rename/nesting), number-literal grammar (`0x`/`0b`/`0o`/`_`/`1e3`),
   bitwise operator set incl. `>>` lexed as two `Gt` — all permanent user-facing syntax chosen in one
   autonomous sweep.
5. **S7a generics details (autonomous)**: PascalCase-only type params (`E-TYPE-CASE`), first-binding-wins
   (non-backtracking) inference, inference-only construction with **no turbofish** (`Box<int>(7)` illegal
   forever unless revisited) — the no-explicit-type-arg call syntax is a notable permanent gap vs TS.
6. **Overnight F-001/F-003 (RATIFIED next morning but shipped first)**: UFCS resolves *any imported
   native by first-param unify* — including number receivers (`n.abs()`) — a broad implicit-resolution
   surface; ambiguity = `E-UFCS-AMBIGUOUS`, which later forced a native rename (`repeat`→`fill`).
7. **M-DX debugger surface (07-01, autonomous slices)**: `phg debug` REPL command set + DAP protocol
   choices + `--dump-on-fault` format — developer-facing tool UX fixed without a surface review.
8. **Dogfood W0/W2 grammar patches (07-01, autonomous)**: empty-list literal init rule, comma-throws,
   nested-quote interpolation semantics — small but permanent grammar decisions.
9. **DEC-070 invariance retrofit (autonomous)**: same-head generic assignability tightened (programs
   that previously type-checked now rejected) — a breaking soundness fix applied without an ask.
10. **DEC-127 `Op::SetIndexLocal` + COW in-place mutation model** (autonomous): observable only via
    performance, but it created a new Op + a subtle aliasing contract (`make_mut` at refcount 1) that
    future features must honor.

**Notable ASKED-but-thin decisions worth re-surfacing during adjudication** (recorded as developer
choices but decided rapidly inside marathons): DEC-133 (concurrency permanently outside the PHP oracle —
the single standing exception to the 3-leg identity claim); DEC-083 (`new` on enum variants — no other
language does this; dev overruled the rec); DEC-096 (`++`/`--` as expressions — overruled after hazard
briefing; `W-SEQUENCE-MUTATION` lint status unverified); DEC-057 D2 revisit (C-8).

## 2026-07-12 adjudication batch (Fable run, session 6 — developer via AskUserQuestion, all Mode: ASKED)

Per the developer's standing instruction this batch records EVERY ruling **with the alternatives
considered and why they lost**. All six pending forks + three run-level meta-rulings cleared in
one sitting (failing programs + after-state previews were embedded in each dialog).

- **DEC-201 — empty collection literals: BOTH contextual typing AND explicit constructors.** *(SUPERSEDED by DEC-214, 2026-07-13 — empty collections now use `new List<T>()`/`new Map<K,V>()`; `[]`/`{}` contextual typing and `List.empty`/`Map.empty` removed; `[1,2,3]` kept. `List.empty` bypassed mandatory-`new` and the contextual typing was "type-from-later-use" inference the developer ruled out.)*
  `List<int> xs = [];` adopts the annotated type in declarations/assignments/call-args/returns,
  AND `List.empty<T>()` / `Map.empty<K,V>()` ship for expression positions with no context.
  *Alternatives:* contextual-only (loses the no-context expression case), constructors-only
  (verbose; the annotation is right there). Both was chosen for completeness.
- **DEC-202 (closes DEC-200) — PHP-reserved top-level type names: REJECT with `E-RESERVED-NAME`.** *(SHIPPED 2026-07-13: `is_php_builtin_class_name` in checker/common.rs — ~100 always-loaded Core/SPL/date/json names, case-insensitive, class-position kinds only; foreign `declare class` binds are EXEMPT by design — they bind to the builtin, nothing redeclares; free functions stay legal (separate PHP namespace); tests in checker/tests/casing.rs + `phg explain E-RESERVED-NAME` updated.)*
  Extend `is_php_reserved_symbol_name` with the full keyword set (derived empirically vs php-8.5.8)
  + the PHP builtin-class core (`Exception`/`Error`/`Closure`/…). *Alternatives:* invisible mangle
  (like enum variants — rejected: silently renames a USER-chosen top-level symbol, surprising on
  PHP interop/debugging); hybrid reject-keywords/mangle-builtins (rejected: two rules where one
  suffices). Legibility + no-surprises won.
- **DEC-203 — scope guard: `using (h = expr) { … }` block** (C#-style; closes at block exit on
  every path incl. throw; the type implements a `Closable` contract; transpiles to PHP
  try/finally). *Alternatives:* Go-style `defer` (rejected: LIFO order + capture timing = new
  footgun surface with no PHP analog); both (rejected: two mechanisms, more spec surface — can be
  revisited if `using` proves insufficient).
- **DEC-204 — graceful shutdown: typed `Runtime.onShutdown(fn)`** (single registration point,
  SIGINT/SIGTERM before exit; vetted `ctrlc` already in-tree; lands with Ω-2 `Core.Process`;
  pairs with DEC-203 for resource cleanup). *Alternatives:* serve-only hook (rejected: CLI worker
  loops still die cold); stay excluded (rejected: kills the Ω-1 web-spine durability story).
- **DEC-205 — Rc cycle leak: BOTH, PHASED — PHP-style threshold cycle collector first (safety:
  `serve` can never leak; semantically invisible, exact PHP engine parity), `Weak<T>` second**
  (zero-overhead idiom for graph back-edges; transpiles 1:1 to PHP `WeakReference` (7.4+), so
  byte-identity holds). Ruled after a perf re-ask: collector ≈ zero steady-state cost
  (root-buffering on decrement + threshold passes), Weak = fastest but not a safety net alone.
  *Alternatives:* collector-only (graph-heavy code pays avoidable passes); Weak-only (a forgotten
  weak edge still leaks in serve — burden on the user).
- **DEC-206 — bare `DateTime`: GATE IT** (`E-INJECTED-TYPE-BARE`, same hint as its Core.Time
  siblings — closes the UA-L2 nothing-in-the-wind inconsistency; the fix for affected code is one
  member-import line). *Alternatives:* un-gate the siblings (repeals nothing-in-the-wind for the
  module); leave-and-document (permanent wart against the #1 recurring design rule).

**Run-level meta-rulings (same sitting):**
- **META-1 — sqlbuild bar: go ALL THE WAY (L2a str-ACL builder → L2b field-transfer → L3
  refcounted JIT handles) until ≥ 1.0× vs php, BEFORE Ω-wave work**; at run end ALL known issues
  and design decisions are reopened for a full re-discussion; every decision records its
  alternatives (this format). *Alternatives:* flag after L2a/L2b (deferred perf debt); flag now
  (fastest breadth) — both rejected for the perf mandate.
- **META-2 — L3 representation constraint: IN-ISLAND, ZERO-DEP** — refcounts live as arena
  bookkeeping inside `src/jit/handles.rs` (the existing audited unsafe island; a parallel
  per-slot count array). Ruled after a dep re-ask: no crate does arena-word refcounting
  (thin-Rc crates target the VM-side Value layer = parked V3b, not L3). *Alternatives:*
  pre-approve `triomphe` for V3b too (broader than needed); decide-per-design (more asks).
- **META-3 — wave order confirmed as written:** Ω-1 Core.Db → HTTP → sessions, then Ω-2…Ω-9
  in sequence. *Alternatives:* language-surface-first, web-spine-depth-first — both declined.

## 2026-07-13 language-reconsideration batch (Opus run — developer via AskUserQuestion, all Mode: ASKED)

Developer-initiated "rethink anything opinionated that should not be in the language," apex filter
= CRAFTSMANSHIP (SOLID / design patterns / best practice), NOT familiarity or minimalism. Each
ruling had a failing/before program + per-option previews embedded in its dialog. Session
certification ran **self-graded** (advisor inactive: advisor==main==Opus 4.8). All items below are
**RULED, build-pending** unless marked SHIPPED. Full research: `scratchpad/verify-*.md`,
`raw-static-access.md`, `raw-core-vs-library.md`, `raw-opinionated-sweep.md`.

- **DEC-207 — static/class-level access separator: adopt `::`.** Class/type-level access uses `::`
  (static methods, static fields/consts, enum-variant construct + match, `parent`); instance access
  stays `.`/`?.` (→PHP `->`/`?->`); module functions stay `.` (a module is a namespace, not a class;
  →PHP free function). Makes static-vs-instance visible at the call site (legibility = a craftsmanship
  axis) and PHP↔Phorj round-trip lossless (transpiler already emits `Counter::make()`/`parent::`; the
  lifter today FLATTENS PHP `::` and `->` both into `.`). Does NOT change checker resolution (stays
  name-based). *Alternatives:* `::` for ALL non-instance incl module fns (rejected — conflates namespace
  with class; dishonest about what a module is); keep unified `.` (rejected — static/instance invisible,
  lossy round-trip). **Partially supersedes the naming-overhaul "unified `.`".**
  *(CODEMOD SCOPE CORRECTION 2026-07-13: NOT ~182 files — module functions like `Output.printLine` STAY
  `.` (R1); the codemod is class-static/const/enum-variant/`parent` accesses — larger than "moderate"
  because enum variants (Result/Option/Json) are pervasive, but NOT the 962 module-fn occurrences.)
  **PART-1 SHIPPED 2026-07-13 (additive — the earlier "no sound partial" fear was WRONG for DEC-207): the
  `::` CAPABILITY.** `TokenKind::ColonColon` + tokenizer two-char rule; `enum MemberSep { Dot, ColonColon }`
  + `sep` field on `Expr::Member` (~36-site ripple, all `Dot`); parser accepts `::` in the postfix member
  loop, `new Enum::Variant`, match patterns, and `parent::`; both printers (format + lift) render `::`;
  lifter maps PHP `::`↔`->` faithfully. **Additive — `.` still works everywhere**; example
  `guide/colon-colon-access.phg` (`MathUtil::square()`/`Counter::start()` static via `::`, `c.add()`
  instance via `.`), byte-identical run/runvm/php, canonical formatting, transpiles to PHP `::`. No new
  `Op`. **PART-2 (enforcement + codemod):** add `E-SEP-MISMATCH` (require `::` for class-static/const/
  enum-variant/parent, `.` for instance/module) at the checker resolution sites; add a `sep` marker to
  `Pattern::Variant` + `ParentCall` so match-patterns and `parent::` also RENDER `::` (part-1 renders
  those back to `.`); then codemod all class-level `.`→`::` across preludes + examples + fixtures
  (enforcement errors pinpoint every site) — the large-but-mechanical migration. FULL IMPL MAP (verified/built in the attempt): (1) token — add
  `TokenKind::ColonColon` (`token.rs`) + a `(b':', Some(b':')) => ColonColon` arm in the tokenizer
  two-char dispatch (`tokenizer/mod.rs:~340`). (2) AST — add `enum MemberSep { Dot, ColonColon }` +
  `sep: MemberSep` field on `Expr::Member` (`ast/exprs.rs`); ~36 sites ripple (26 construction → `Dot`,
  10 match → `sep: _`); a subagent did this once cleanly. NB the ~9 rewrite passes that rebuild `Member`
  clobber `sep`→`Dot` but that's HARMLESS — `sep` only matters pre-rewrite (formatter reads the raw
  parser AST; checker enforces during type-check; backends ignore it). (3) Parser — postfix loop accepts
  `Dot|QuestionDot|ColonColon`, sets `sep` (`parser/exprs/climb.rs`, done); STILL TODO: enum-variant
  construct (`new Enum::Variant` — the `new` dotted chain) + match patterns (`Enum::Variant` in
  `parser/patterns.rs`) + `parent::` (parse_parent_call). (4) CHECKER ENFORCEMENT (the semantic core) —
  at each Member resolution (`calls/core.rs::check_call`, `calls/methods.rs::check_member`, enum-variant
  + const + parent sites), after the existing name-based kind resolution, require `sep==ColonColon` for
  class-static/const/enum-variant/parent and `sep==Dot` for instance/module, else `E-SEP-MISMATCH`.
  (5) Formatter — render `::`/`.`/`?.` from `sep` (`format/printer/exprs.rs` Member arm). (6) Lifter —
  PHP `::` → `ColonColon`, `->`/`.` → `Dot` (`lift/lifter/exprs.rs`, currently flattens both to `.`).
  (7) Codemod all class-level accesses in examples/conformance/tests → `::` + fixtures. (8) Gate. Steps
  (1)-(3) mechanical; (4) is the real work but comparatively mechanical (kind already known at each site).)*
- **DEC-208 — DB: drop the query builder from the language; ship an enhanced-PDO primitive.** The SQL
  query builder leaves the language AND is NOT a first-party library (any builder = 100% userland).
  Phorj instead provides an **enhanced PDO-style DB primitive** (better than PHP's PDO — surface TBD
  in a follow-up design round: typed, Result-returning, prepared-statement-first, no silent coercion).
  **Strict import discipline reaffirmed: always `import` required, nothing inferred, nothing in the
  wind.** *Alternatives:* seam — move the web spine (Sql/Db/HTTP/Router/Sessions/Template/Dotenv) to
  first-party bundled libraries via the existing `phorj.toml`/`phg vendor` path (RECOMMENDED by the
  analysis but OVERRULED — dev wants the low-level primitive, not a curated builder); keep in Core
  (rejected — heavier than PHP's floor, couples app concerns to the language). **Supersedes the shipped
  Core.Sql DBAL slices + the DEC-era Core.Sql design.**
  - **SURFACE RULED 2026-07-13 (ASKED, two AskUserQuestion rounds).** The enhanced-PDO primitive =
    **shape 1 + shape 3 combined** — a strongly-typed PDO with generics. `import Core.Db` required.
    - **Connection:** `Db db = new Db("sqlite:app.db")` (DSN string; mandatory `new`).
    - **Prepared-first:** `Statement s = db.prepare(sql)`; every path goes through a `Statement`.
    - **Both bind styles** (chosen): positional `s.bind(v)` (`?` placeholders, left-to-right) AND named
      `s.bindNamed("name", v)` (`:name`); mutually exclusive per statement; binds are chainable and typed.
    - **Dynamic path (shape 1, KEPT):** `Rows rows = s.query()` → `for (Row r in rows) { r.getInt("c");
      r.getString("name"); ... }` — typed accessors, no silent coercion; for ad-hoc/aggregate SQL where no
      result class exists (`COUNT(*)`, exploratory).
    - **Typed-generic path (shape 3):** `List<T> = s.queryInto<T>()` and `T? = s.queryOneInto<T>()`
      (0 rows → `null`, 1 → the object, >1 → `DbError`). Row→object mapping is **by field NAME, STRICT**
      (chosen): every public field of `T` must have a same-named result column; a type mismatch OR a SQL
      NULL into a non-optional field → `DbError`; extra columns ignored; declare `int? age` to admit NULL.
    - **Writes:** `int n = s.exec()` → affected-row count.
    - **Errors:** a checked `DbError` (thrown, never PDO's silent `false`/`null`); propagated with `?` like
      any checked fault. Enhancements over PDO: strong typing + generics + strict mapping + no silent
      coercion + checked errors + mandatory prepared statements.
    - **LADDER (invariant 14):** transpile leg is **faithful (case 1)** — maps to PHP PDO
      (`new PDO(dsn)`, `prepare`/`bindValue`/`execute`/`fetch*`, object hydration). Native leg executes
      over `rusqlite` (`db` feature, already vetted — UNIFIED-SPEC §External dependency policy Q1/Q2).
    - **SPINE TREATMENT:** per the adopted plan (UNIFIED-SPEC P2/Tier-B) DB *execution* is **Tier-3
      fixture-tested, NOT in the example-glob byte-identity spine** (live I/O can't be trivially
      byte-identical rusqlite-vs-PDO); the surface's *parse/check/transpile-shape* stays spine-tested.
    - **Alternatives (this round):** shape 1 only (PDO-faithful, no generics — rejected, dev wants
      generics); shape 2 one-shot `db.query(sql, binds)` (rejected — no Statement reuse); mapping by
      constructor-order (rejected — order-fragile); lenient mapping (rejected — silent-default footgun);
      positional-only / named-only binds (rejected — dev chose both); `queryOneInto():T`-throws or
      no-single-helper (rejected — dev chose `T?`); generics-only, drop dynamic path (rejected — dev keeps
      both). *Build is multi-slice; slice plan in MASTER-PLAN §0.1.*
  - **ERROR-MECHANISM RULED 2026-07-13 (ASKED) = Option A: prelude-wrapper over result-returning
    natives.** Blocker found while building: phorj's native ABI has no throws channel — a native's
    `Err(String)` is a HARD, uncatchable fault (only `Op::Throw` from phorj-source is catchable), so
    routing `db.prepare(...)` to a plain `CallNative` cannot express the ruled catchable `throws DbError`
    (Q6). Ruling: the `Db`/`Statement`/`Row` surface methods are **phorj-source prelude methods declared
    `throws DbError`**; the Rust natives (src/native/db.rs) **return a result-encoding value (ok | error),
    never fault**; the prelude inspects it and `throw`s a real `DbError` (the same catchable mechanism
    Core.Sql's `?`-throws used). No native-ABI change; spine-safe; reuses proven machinery. *Implication
    for the build:* commit 2's natives must be reworked from `Err(String)`-on-SQL-error to returning a
    result value; the S1 surface (commit 3) becomes prelude classes wrapping the opaque native handle
    rather than pure built-in-class recognition. *S2 caveat noted:* the type-directed `queryInto<T>`
    hydration still needs a native returning the same result-encoding convention. *Alternatives:* B —
    extend the native ABI with a `throws` channel (cleaner call sites, benefits all future throwing
    natives, but a cross-cutting spine-adjacent change — REJECTED as too big for the need now); C —
    DbError as a hard uncatchable fault (REJECTED — reverses Q6, un-PDO-like, no in-language recovery).
- **DEC-209 — match legibility: reject bare PascalCase arms; `default` is the catch-all; `_` = ignore-only.**
  A lone PascalCase ident arm (`Circle =>`) currently becomes a SILENT catch-all binding — verified
  live: `match(s){Circle=>"c"}` returns "c" for a `Square` (byte-identity holds across all 4 backends,
  so a legibility/refuse-to-lie footgun, not a spine break). Reject it with `E-MATCH-BARE-VARIANT`
  (hint the 3 intents). The standalone catch-all keyword becomes **`default`** (PHP-match aligned), NOT
  `_`; `_` survives ONLY as an ignore-placeholder (type-test `Square _`, unused bindings). *Alternatives:*
  warn-only (rejected — ignored warnings still ship wrong-but-passing programs); keep silent (rejected);
  full `Shape.Circle` qualification (rejected — breaks idiomatic bare `Circle() =>`); remove `_` entirely
  (rejected — forces named-but-unused bindings); keep both `_` and `default` as catch-all (rejected — TIMTOWTDI).
  Closes DEC-056d. *(SHIPPED 2026-07-13: parser `parse_arm_pattern` (`default`→Wildcard catch-all;
  standalone `_`→`E-MATCH-BARE-VARIANT`) + bare-PascalCase rejection in `parse_pattern`; formatter + lift
  printer render a top-level catch-all Wildcard as `default`; `phg explain E-MATCH-BARE-VARIANT`; nullary
  variant matches now require `Name()` (bare `Red`→`Red()`); codemod of all `_ =>` + bare-variant arms
  across examples/conformance/bench/tests; new parser tests; full oracle gate 1974 green.)*
- **DEC-210 — `++`/`--` ratified STATEMENT-ONLY; register corrected.** The code is already statement-only
  (`parser/stmts.rs`, desugar `x=x+1`; `x=i++`/`a[i++]=i++` are parse errors) — the craftsmanship-correct
  design with no sequence-point footgun expressible. The register's DEC-096 row wrongly marked the
  expression-form + a `W-SEQUENCE-MUTATION` lint as shipped; both were OVERRULED 2026-06-25 and never
  built. Ruling: affirm statement-only, mark DEC-096 superseded/never-built. No code change. *Alternatives:*
  build expr-form + the lint (rejected — reintroduces the eliminated footgun). Corrects/supersedes DEC-096.
- **DEC-211 — generic type bounds: add `T: Interface`/trait.** A type param may be bounded to an
  interface/trait, enforced at BOTH the definition site (body limited to the bound's members) and
  instantiation (the type arg must implement it); erased to PHP interface calls. Bare `<T>` stays legal.
  Closes the "maximal generics" hole (`function max<T: Comparable>(a:T,b:T):T` is unwritable today —
  `a>b` on bare `T` is rejected). Reuses the existing interface/trait conformance table. *Alternatives:*
  stay bound-less (rejected — `max`/`sort` unwritable); hardcode magic `Comparable`/`Numeric` (rejected —
  the one-domain-hardcode anti-pattern this sweep removes elsewhere). (Doc fix: UNIFIED-SPEC:104 says
  "monomorphized"; impl is ERASURE everywhere else. Memory index "trait CLOSED" is wrong — DEC-177 blessed traits.)
  *(SHIPPED 2026-07-13 — full + sound. Both halves built: (a) def-site — a bounded `Ty::Param(T)`'s
  member access resolves against its bound interface (`check_method_call` remap) + a bounded `T` is
  `ty_assignable` to its bound (so `a.cmp(b)` with `b: T` type-checks); (b) instantiation — after θ binds
  `T:=X` in `check_generic_call`, `X` must implement the bound or `E-BOUND-NOT-SATISFIED`. Bounds
  threaded via `active_type_param_bounds`/`cur_class_type_param_bounds` (checker context) + `FnSig`; the
  formatter renders `<T: Bound>` (`type_params_body`); pre-check rewrite passes (rewrite_alias/
  collapse_injected) PRESERVE bounds (the key bug: they'd dropped them to `Vec::new()` before the check).
  Example `guide/generic-bounds.phg`, checker test `generic_bound_enforced_at_definition_and_instantiation`,
  `phg explain E-BOUND-NOT-SATISFIED`. Full oracle 1976 green; clippy both + fmt clean; byte-identical.
  The earlier "no committable partial" was right — so it was built whole, not partial. FULL IMPL
  MAP (verified sites): (1) AST — add `type_param_bounds: Vec<(String,String)>` to FunctionDecl/ClassDecl/
  EnumDecl (`ast/decls.rs`); ~31 construction sites need the field (parser sites use the parsed value, all
  backend/erasure/rebuild/test sites `Vec::new()`). (2) Parser — `parse_type_params` (`parser/types.rs`)
  returns `(Vec<String>, Vec<(String,String)>)`, parsing an optional `: Interface` per param; its 4
  callers destructure. (3) Checker context — add `active_type_param_bounds` + `cur_class_type_param_bounds`
  to the Checker (`checker/mod.rs:453/457`), set/clear ALONGSIDE `active_type_params` (in
  `program/type_bodies.rs` method/ctor/hook sites + `check_function` for free fns). (4) DEF-SITE — in
  `check_method_call` (`calls/methods.rs:6`), just before `match base`, remap a `Ty::Param(p)` that has an
  active bound `B` to `Ty::Named(B, vec![])` so the existing interface-method-resolution arm types the
  call against the bound (one clean remap). (5) INSTANTIATION (soundness-critical) — in the generic-call
  unify path (`check_generic_call`/`unify`+θ), after θ binds `T:=X`, check `X` implements each bounded
  `T`'s interface via `ast::class_implements` (`ast/class_hierarchy.rs:17`); else `E-BOUND-NOT-SATISFIED`.
  (6) Erased before backends. (7) Tests: `max<T:Comparable>` body `a.cmp(b)` type-checks; `max<Socket>`
  rejected; bare `<T>` still legal; example. Steps (1)-(3) mechanical (~40 min, a subagent did (1) once);
  (4)+(5) are the real type-system work.)*
- **DEC-212 — domain literals: generalize `html"…"` to a tagged-template primitive.** The language gains
  ONE general tagged-template mechanism (a user-definable interpolation handler returning a typed
  newtype); `html` becomes a first-party library on it, keeping the EXACT escaping kernel
  (`htmlspecialchars(ENT_QUOTES,'UTF-8')`), the erased `Html`/`Attr` newtypes, and byte-identity. No more
  hardcoded domain literals in the lexer. Consistent with DEC-208 (domains live as libraries; the language
  provides the primitive) + nothing-in-the-wind (import-gated). *Alternatives:* keep hardcoded `html`,
  add no more (rejected — a permanent lexer special-case that doesn't generalize).
  **SURFACE RULED 2026-07-13 (developer via AskUserQuestion): BOTH modes.** Any `tag"…literal{hole}…"`
  (an ident directly before `"`) is a tagged template; the checker resolves `tag` and picks the desugar:
  (1) **protocol mode** — `tag` provides `raw`/`text`/`concat` (+ a typed newtype) → desugars EXACTLY like
  html today (`tag.concat([tag.raw(lit), tag.text(hole), …])`, escape-by-default kernel); html becomes one
  such tag, kernel unchanged. (2) **function mode** — `tag` is a function `(List<string> literals,
  List<H> holes) -> R` → desugars to `tag([lits], [holes])` (JS-style; the handler owns escaping). Part-1 =
  the general primitive with both modes, html re-expressed as a protocol tag (still built-in, additive);
  part-2 = migrate `html` to a first-party library once the library-delivery path lands (DEC-218).
  *(PART-1 SHIPPED 2026-07-13: any `ident"…"` is a tagged template (`TokenKind::TaggedTemplate` + lexer
  ident-glued-to-`"` rule; `Expr::TaggedTemplate`; `html` kept on its own `Expr::Html` path unchanged).
  `check_tagged_template` (checker/expr/literals.rs) resolves the tag: FUNCTION mode when it names a
  non-overloaded free function → `tag([lits],[holes])`; PROTOCOL mode when it names a type/module with
  raw/text/concat → `tag.concat([tag.raw(lit), tag.text(hole),…])`; else `E-UNKNOWN-TAG`. The desugar is
  stored + applied by `resolve_html` (erased before backends). Formatter/lift render `tag"…"`. Example
  `guide/tagged-templates.phg` (both modes), checker test `tagged_template_unknown_tag_rejected`,
  `phg explain E-UNKNOWN-TAG`. Full oracle 1978 green; clippy both + fmt clean; byte-identical; no new Op.
  PART-2 remains: migrate `html` off its special path onto this primitive as a first-party library (DEC-218).)*
- **DEC-213 — PHP-name collision: fix the live byte-identity bug; keep the reject/mangle axis.**
  BUG (G-1 spine break, verified): the enum-variant mangle list (~17 engine-core names,
  `transpile/names.rs`) is a strict SUBSET of the DEC-202 reject list (~100 preloaded builtins,
  `checker/common.rs`), so a variant named `DateTime`/`RuntimeException`/`ArrayObject` runs (exit 0) but
  its transpiled PHP throws `Cannot redeclare class DateTime` — masked only because no example uses one.
  Fix: feed BOTH the reject and the mangle from ONE shared builtin-class constant. The reject-vs-mangle
  AXIS is principled and KEPT (human-chosen API name = loud `E-RESERVED-NAME`; impl-detail variant =
  silent mangle). *Alternatives:* emission-side isolation / always-namespaced output (would drop both the
  reject and the mangle so a phorj programmer may name a class `Exception` — truest to "bridge not soul",
  but a spine-level full byte-identity re-baseline of every single-package example; DECLINED for now,
  not scheduled); unify toward one policy all-reject/all-mangle (rejected — worse both ways). This is a
  correctness fix, implemented independent of the surface rulings. *(SHIPPED `b8dd069`: `src/php_names.rs`
  single-sources the builtin-class list; `checker/common.rs` re-exports it, `transpile/names.rs` group-3
  calls it; differential example `transpile/enum_variant_builtin_names.phg`; full oracle gate 1973 green.)*
- **DEC-214 — empty collections via `new List<T>()` / `new Map<K,V>()`; SUPERSEDES DEC-201.** Empty
  collections are CONSTRUCTED with mandatory `new` (`new List<int>()`, `new Map<string,int>()`); the
  empty-literal contextual typing (`var xs = [];` inferred from later use) AND the `List.empty<T>()` /
  `Map.empty<K,V>()` static factories are both REMOVED. Non-empty literals `[1,2,3]` stay (element type
  is locally obvious, not "in the wind"). Local scalar inference (`var n = 42`) stays. Rationale:
  `List.empty<T>()` bypassed the mandatory-`new` tenet, and empty-literal "type from later use" is exactly
  the inference the developer's "nothing inferred" rules out. *Alternatives:* all collections via `new`
  incl. `[1,2,3]` → `new List<int>(1,2,3)`, remove bracket literals entirely (rejected — loses ergonomic
  literals where the type is self-evident); keep DEC-201 (rejected — retains the `new`-bypass factory +
  the type-from-later-use inference). **Supersedes DEC-201.** *(PART-1 SHIPPED 2026-07-13: the
  `new List<T>()` / `new Map<K,V>()` CAPABILITY — `Expr::NewColl` + `CollKind`, parser reuses
  `parse_type` for the generic head, checker `check_new_coll` self-types via `resolve_type`, all 3
  backends build an empty collection (transpile→`[]`), formatter/lift render, parser test + example
  `guide/empty-collections.phg`; PURELY ADDITIVE — `[]` still works. Full oracle 1975 green. `Set`
  deferred (no empty-set VM op → would need a new `Op`). **PART-2 PENDING**: remove the empty-`[]`
  contextual typing (calls/args.rs `check_arg` + `thread_literal_expected` empty-list path + decl/return
  threading) so bare `[]` errors "use `new List<T>()`", then codemod every empty-`[]` across the repo —
  a DEC-209-sized churn; separate slice, fresh context. **RE-SEQUENCED (2026-07-13, evidence-based):
  the 3-edit checker removal was ATTEMPTED and REVERTED — measured blast radius = 9 differential
  examples + 7 checker/JIT tests, and critically the empty-`[]` sites are DOMINATED by (a) the WEB
  examples (router/middleware/controller/route-constraints/router-attrs) that DEC-218 EXTERNALIZES and
  (b) the Core.Sql PRELUDE (the sqlbuild/union-dyn JIT tests broke — the prelude uses empty `[]`) that
  DEC-208 EXTERNALIZES. Doing part-2 now = prelude surgery + double-churn on code about to leave the
  language. CORRECT ORDER: DEC-208 (Sql prelude → userland) + DEC-218 (web spine → userland) FIRST,
  THEN part-2 codemods only the small remaining general-purpose empty-`[]` set. Part-2 depends on
  DEC-208/DEC-218.)*
- **DEC-215 — DI stays compile-time; L1/L2 refactor affirmed, scheduled Ω-4/Ω-7.** DI v1 is a 1292-LOC
  bespoke COMPILER pass (`desugar_di/`, pre-check, `Expr::Inject`) — the same "app framework privileged
  into the compiler" category as the ejected SQL builder (DEC-208). The spec's own ruling stands: build a
  generic L1 attribute-reflection primitive (compile-time attribute enumeration + `subjectsWith<Attr>()`
  discovery) and rewrite DI as an L2 consumer (routing/ORM/validation ride the same L1). DI MUST remain
  compile-time — a pure-runtime `.phg` DI library is infeasible (`inject<T>()` is type-directed and PHP
  erases types → byte-identity break). Execute at the SCHEDULED wave (Ω-4/Ω-7); DI v1 stays as-is until
  then (green, contained). *Alternatives:* pull the L1/L2 refactor forward now (rejected — reorders ahead
  of priorities, ~1300 LOC, buys nothing while DI v1 works); keep DI compiler-baked permanently (rejected
  — contradicts the spec's L1/L2 ruling + the DEC-208 principle).

**Session meta-rulings (2026-07-13):**
- **META-4 — unify ALL plans/specs into the two SSOTs** (developer, mid-session): `MASTER-PLAN.md`
  (roadmap) + `UNIFIED-SPEC.md` (surface) + this register (decisions). No standalone plan/spec files;
  the language-reconsideration working plan is folded into MASTER-PLAN and retired.
- **META-5 — session certification is self-graded + disclosed** (advisor inactive: advisor==main==Opus 4.8).
- **META-6 — GOVERNING PHILOSOPHY (developer, 2026-07-13): rich core, zero-cost safe sugar, no bloat.**
  The language is RICH — it does everything PHP does, **better / faster / safer / more secure** — plus
  **safe sugar that must NOT affect performance** (zero-cost or it doesn't ship). It is deliberately
  **NOT bloated**: anything that should be a library IS a library, never baked into the language. Every
  feature is adjudicated through the **"in-language vs externalize" lens** — IN if it is a core
  capability that beats PHP or is zero-cost safe sugar; OUT (library / separate tool) if it is an
  application-domain or packaging concern. Applications so far: DEC-208 (SQL builder → userland),
  DEC-215 (DI → L1/L2 library), DEC-216 (package management → separate). Refines the craftsmanship apex
  filter (`memory/philosophy-of-phorge.md`). **Next design activity: a systematic feature-by-feature
  in-language-vs-externalize audit of the current surface.**
- **DEC-216 — PENDING (developer lean, 2026-07-13): package management is SEPARATE from the language.**
  `phg vendor` + `phorj.toml` should likely leave the language — "the language does not need to handle
  package management; it needs to be separate." Ladder to adjudicate (present with previews, recommended
  first): (1) **remove entirely** — no dependency mechanism in `phg` at all; (2) **dumb `vendor/`
  consumption** — `phg` still resolves imports from a pre-populated `vendor/` dir (offline), but the
  fetch command + manifest leave `phg` to an external companion tool; (3) **external tool owns
  everything** (manifest + fetch + vendor); `phg` is package-agnostic. Impacts `examples/project/withdeps`
  + `src/loader/` + `src/manifest.rs`. Blocks nothing; adjudicate after DEC-214.
- **IN-LANGUAGE-vs-EXTERNALIZE AUDIT (2026-07-13, 4-agent sweep — full doc `docs/research/2026-07-13-externalize-audit.md`).**
  Applied META-6 to the whole surface. KEEP-CORE: stdlib primitives + native-backed app primitives
  (Crypto/File/Path/Process/Env/Reflection/Runtime/Url/Secret/Db/Csv/Ini) + language capabilities +
  zero-cost sugar + the language toolchain (transpile/format/test/…). EXTERNALIZE candidates (ranked):
  package-mgmt (DEC-216), Http (→primitive+userland), DI (DEC-215), **desugar_router (NEW — a 489-LOC
  web-framework compiler pass, peer to DI; same DEC-215 L1/L2 treatment)**, serve, lift, lsp, Time
  (calendar→lib, keep clock), Validation, html (DEC-212), Dotenv/Event/Cli/Log/Uuid/Sessions/Serde/
  Template (→userland), debug/DAP. New PENDING adjudications surfaced:
  - **DEC-217 — PENDING: Test framework in-language or userland?** Genuine tie — PHPUnit is PHP
    *userland* (externalize) vs Rust/Go ship a *built-in* runner (keep). Surface with both precedents.
  - **DEC-218 — PENDING: externalize DELIVERY destination** — userland (DEC-208 style) vs first-party
    bundled lib (DEC-212 style). **Must be ruled WITH DEC-216** (if packaging is removed, a "userland"
    web spine has no distribution path).
  - **DEC-219 — PENDING: overloading dispatch** — resolve statically where arg types are known
    (zero-cost) vs current runtime multiple-dispatch (per-call cost); a META-6 zero-cost-sugar tension.
  Suggested ruling order: DEC-216+DEC-218 together → DEC-215 family (DI + desugar_router) → per-module
  moves (Http/Time/Validation) → DEC-217 → DEC-219. Every move a tracked, tested, register-recorded slice.

**Audit adjudications RULED (2026-07-13 batch 2, developer via AskUserQuestion):**
- **DEC-216 — RULED: SPLIT.** phg KEEPS import/module resolution + offline `vendor/` consumption (it is
  the language's import system); `phg vendor` fetch + `phorj.toml` + lock MOVE to a separate companion
  tool (rustc/cargo, go/`go mod` model). The language stays package-agnostic (no network, no manifest);
  userland libs still work (the tool populates `vendor/`, phg consumes it offline). *Alternatives:* remove
  entirely (kills third-party libs); keep in phg (the rejected status quo). Impacts src/manifest.rs +
  src/lock.rs + the vendor subcommand (extract to the tool) — loader's resolution stays.
- **DEC-218 — RULED: userland libraries + Core primitives** (consistent with DEC-208). Externalized web
  spine (Http/router/sessions, Dotenv/Event/Cli/Log/Uuid/Serde, Template, SQL builder) ships as USERLAND
  libraries via the DEC-216 vendor path; Core keeps only the thin primitive each rides. **Http-primitive
  note (developer):** the Core HTTP primitive must expose HTTP verbs (GET/POST/HEAD/…) + request
  bodies/file uploads in a **clean, well-organized OOP** way (not a flat function bag). *Alternatives:*
  first-party bundled libs (curated but phg-adjacent); keep-in-Core (bloat).
- **DEC-217 — RULED: keep `phg test` built-in** (Rust/Go toolchain precedent; phg's byte-identity
  discipline is testing-centric — a first-class runner is core identity, not bloat). *Alternative:*
  userland test lib (PHPUnit precedent) — declined.
- **DEC-219 — RULED: static overload resolution** — the checker picks the overload at compile time when
  argument types are statically known (zero-cost direct call); runtime multiple-dispatch remains ONLY for
  genuinely union-typed args. A META-6 zero-cost win, no surface change. *Alternative:* always-runtime
  dispatch (per-call cost) — declined. ⚠ soundness: subtype refinement can make runtime dispatch ≠ static
  selection (`f(Animal)`+`f(Dog)`, arg static `Animal` holding a `Dog`) — the sound subset is where no
  runtime refinement can change the selection (safe approx: primitive/leaf arg types). Deferred (low
  priority vs the DB/output work).
- **DEC-221 — RULED (ASKED 2026-07-13): throwing constructors.** phorj constructors could not declare
  `throws` (a `constructor(...) throws E` was a parse error; a throwing call in a ctor body had no
  `?`/try escape), which forced DEC-208's fail-able open into a static factory `Db.connect(dsn)` —
  deviating from the ruled `new Db(dsn)`. Ruling: **make constructors able to declare + propagate
  `throws`** so `new Db(dsn) throws DbError` works, exactly as ruled and exactly like PHP's `new PDO`
  (fail-fast + PHP-faithful + enriches ALL fallible construction, not just Db). *Alternatives:* keep the
  `Db.connect` factory (rejected — permanent deviation from the ruling + PHP; the "named constructor"
  idiom is clean but not what was ruled); lazy-open to preserve `new Db` syntactically (rejected —
  fail-LATE, a bad DSN constructs "fine" and errors on first use, disconnecting error from cause).
  **Impl:** (1) AST — add `throws: Vec<Type>` to `ClassMember::Constructor` (`ast/decls.rs:189`; ~60
  match/construct sites, most use `..`). (2) Parser — parse an optional `throws` clause (reuse
  `parse_throws_clause`, `parser/types.rs:31`) between `)` and `{` at BOTH ctor parser sites
  (`parser/items/types.rs:318`, `parser/items/decls.rs:423`). (3) Checker — store the ctor throws on the
  class's ctor signature (`collect/types_decls.rs` ctor build); check the ctor BODY with those throws in
  context (so its throwing calls discharge, like `check_function`); at `check_new` (`expr/core.rs:252`)
  route the ctor's throws to `route_call_throw` so `new X(...)` is a throwing expression the caller must
  handle/propagate. (4) Formatter — render `throws` on ctors. (5) Then convert DB_PRELUDE `Db.connect`
  back to `constructor(string dsn) throws DbError { this.raw = match(...){...} }` + example `new Db(dsn)`.
- **DEC-220 — RULED (ASKED 2026-07-13): unified output/log/response system (Output/Log/Response), 3 named
  sinks + opt-in capture.** Prompted by a real bug the dev hit: `Output.print*` in a `phg serve` handler
  goes to the SERVER LOG (stderr), not the browser (`serve/handlers.rs:182`) — a context-magical redirect
  (stdout in CLI, stderr-log in serve). The challenge (accepted): the fix is EXPLICIT NAMED sinks, not
  making `Output` more ambient. Ruling — three context-independent sinks:
  (1) **`Output.*` → process STDOUT, always** (CLI). The serve-only Output→stderr redirect is REMOVED.
  (2) **`Log.debug/info/warn/error(msg)` → structured, leveled STDERR** — first-class server/app logging
  (beats PHP `error_log`). New `Core.Log` module.
  (3) **`Response.html/text/json/bytes(..).status(n).withHeader(k,v).withCookie(..)` → the browser** — a
  typed builder; headers-before-body enforced structurally (PHP's "headers already sent" impossible).
  PLUS **`Response.capture(() => { Output.printLine(..) })`** — opt-in PHP-like echo-into-body within an
  EXPLICIT scope (no ambient state; combines the "explicit builder" + "capture block" options).
  Ties into DEC-218 (Core.Http/Response + Log as thin Core primitives; richer helpers userland). Byte-id:
  Log→stderr is invisible to the stdout differential; Response is a value (the portable `handle(Request):
  Response` unit). *Alternatives:* ambient echo (Output writes to the response in a handler — REJECTED,
  implicit ambient sink + PHP header/buffer footguns); leaner 3-sinks WITHOUT capture (REJECTED — dev
  wants the opt-in ergonomic); keep the current serve Output→stderr magic (REJECTED — the reported bug).
  *Build (fresh context, multi-slice):* S1 `Core.Log` (leveled natives → stderr; additive, self-contained)
  · S2 `Response` builders (`.html/.text/.json/.status/.withHeader/.withCookie`) replacing raw
  `new Response(status,bytes,headers)` + remove the serve Output→stderr redirect (Output stays stdout) ·
  S3 `Response.capture(fn)` opt-in buffering. Each = Invariant-9 example + gate.
  *STATUS:* S1 SHIPPED (`Core.Log`). **S2 SHIPPED** (2026-07-14): `Response.html/json` + immutable
  `.status(n)`/`.withHeader(k,v)`/`.withCookie(k,v)` in `HTTP_PRELUDE`; serve `respond_once` now sends a
  handler's captured stdout to the server's real STDOUT (was stderr); example
  `examples/web/response-builders.phg` byte-identical `run`≡`runvm`≡php-8.5.8; full gate green.
  **S3 = PENDING (blocked on a design/adjudication call — DEC-220-S3 below).**
- **DEC-220-S3 — PENDING (autonomous, 2026-07-14): `Response.capture` forces a new ambient name via the
  prelude.** A working, byte-identical (`run`≡`runvm`≡php-8.5.8) implementation was built and then
  REVERTED (not shipped) because it violates the hard "nothing in the wind" rule. Mechanism: `Response`
  lives in `HTTP_PRELUDE`; for its static `Response.capture` to call the capture native it must resolve
  `Output.capture`, and phorj has NO fully-qualified `Core.Output.capture(...)` call form (that parses as
  `unknown identifier Core`) — the only way is `import Core.Output;` in the prelude. But prelude top-level
  imports MERGE into user scope (a pre-existing behavior: `import Core.Http` already makes
  `Bytes`/`String`/`List`/`Regex` resolvable without the user importing them), so adding `import Core.Output`
  makes `Output.*` resolvable in ANY program that does `import Core.Http.Response` alone. Embedded evidence
  (the leak, minimal): a program with `import Core.Http.Response;` + `Output.printLine("x")` in `main`
  type-checks and runs (Output resolves) ONLY when the prelude imports Core.Output; with zero imports
  `Output` is correctly `unknown identifier`. *Options for the developer:* (a) ACCEPT the leak as consistent
  with the existing 4-module prelude-transitive-import behavior (batteries-included facade); (b) REJECT it;
  (c) the real fix — scope prelude imports so they do NOT merge into user scope (also removes the 4
  pre-existing leaks, but changes shipped behavior → riskier); (d) sanction `Output.capture(() -> void) ->
  string` as an explicit, import-gated PRIMITIVE (user writes `import Core.Output;` themselves → no leak) and
  drop the prelude `Response.capture` wrapper (deviates from the ruled surface). *Implementation that was
  proven (ready to re-apply once ruled):* new `NativeEval::Capturing` variant + `CapturingInvoker` type
  (`native/mod.rs`); `output_capture` native (`Core.Output.capture`, `pure:true` — byte-identical like
  `List.map`); interpreter arm (`interpreter/call.rs`, mirrors the HigherOrder throw structure) + VM arm
  (`vm/exec.rs`), both doing `out.split_off(start)` to divert the closure's output; transpile gated helper
  `__phorj_capture($fn){ ob_start(); $fn(); return ob_get_clean(); }` (`transpile/{mod,call,runtime_php}.rs`)
  + `ob_start`/`ob_get_clean` added to `TIER1_PHP` in `tests/differential.rs`; prelude static
  `Response.capture((() -> void) render): Response { return Response.html(Output.capture(render)); }`; example
  `examples/web/response-capture.phg`. Recommended: (d) if a capture surface is wanted now without the
  architectural change, else (a) to ship `Response.capture` as ruled.
