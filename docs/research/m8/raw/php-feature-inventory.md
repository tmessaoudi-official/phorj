# PHP Feature Inventory — PHP 8.0 → 8.6 (for the PHP → Phorge importer)

> Coverage analysis for designing a **PHP → Phorge importer**. Phorge is statically typed,
> immutable/acyclic-heap, no associative `Map` primitive, no `eval`, no variable-variables.
> The goal is the full syntactic + semantic surface, with **explicit flagging of every
> feature a static, immutable, no-Map language CANNOT accept**.

## (1) Type system

| Feature | Version | Category | One-line semantics | Type-system relevance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Union types `A\|B` | 8.0 | Type system | A value may be one of several declared types. `[RUNTIME]` (runtime type check) | core — sum-type-like; Phorge needs union or rejection |
| `mixed` type | 8.0 | Type system | Explicit "any type" top type for params/returns/props. `[RUNTIME]` | IMPORTANT — maps to a top/`Any` type Phorge may not have |
| `static` return type | 8.0 | Type system | Return type "the late-static-bound class". `[RUNTIME]` | core — depends on late static binding |
| `false` pseudo-type (in unions) | 8.0 | Type system | `false` usable inside a union (e.g. `string\|false`). `[RUNTIME]` | aux — literal type in a union |
| `null` in union (nullable) `?T` / `T\|null` | 8.0 (pre-existing, formalised) | Type system | Value may be the declared type or null. `[RUNTIME]` | core — Phorge optionals `T?` map here |
| `never` return type | 8.1 | Type system | Function never returns (exits, throws, or loops forever). `[RUNTIME]` (bottom type) | core — bottom type; affects exhaustiveness |
| Intersection types `A&B` | 8.1 | Type system | Value must satisfy all listed (class/interface) types simultaneously. `[RUNTIME]` | core — Phorge has no intersection → likely UN-IMPORTABLE or approximated |
| Pure intersection of interfaces only | 8.1 | Type system | Intersection restricted to class/interface names (no scalars). `[RUNTIME]` | core |
| `readonly` properties | 8.1 | Type system | Property assignable once (in declaring scope), then immutable. `[RUNTIME]` | IMPORTANT — aligns with Phorge immutability |
| `enum` (pure) | 8.1 | Type system / OOP | Named finite set of singleton cases; a first-class type. `[RUNTIME]` | core — maps to Phorge enums |
| `enum` backed (int/string) | 8.1 | Type system / OOP | Enum cases carry a scalar backing value; `from()`/`tryFrom()`. `[RUNTIME]` | core — maps to Phorge backed-ish enums |
| `new` in initializers | 8.1 | Type system | Object instances allowed as param/prop/const default values. `[RUNTIME]` | aux — affects default-value evaluation |
| `readonly` classes | 8.2 | Type system / OOP | All properties of the class are implicitly `readonly`. `[RUNTIME]` | IMPORTANT — whole-type immutability |
| Standalone `null` type | 8.2 | Type system | `null` usable as a sole type declaration. `[RUNTIME]` | aux — unit/null type |
| Standalone `false` type | 8.2 | Type system | `false` usable as a sole type declaration. `[RUNTIME]` | aux — singleton literal type |
| Standalone `true` type | 8.2 | Type system | `true` usable as a sole type declaration. `[RUNTIME]` | aux — singleton literal type |
| DNF types `(A&B)\|C` | 8.2 | Type system | Disjunctive-normal-form combination of intersection + union. `[RUNTIME]` | core — Phorge lacks intersection → mostly UN-IMPORTABLE |
| Constants in traits | 8.2 | OOP / Type system | Traits may declare constants. `[RUNTIME]` | aux |
| Typed class constants | 8.3 | Type system | `const T NAME = …;` — class/interface/trait/enum constants carry a declared type. `[RUNTIME]` | core — typed constants map cleanly |
| Generics | (none, all versions) | Type system | **PHP has NO generics.** Only docblock `@template` (erased, comment-only). | IMPORTANT — Phorge generics are compile-time-only & PHP-absent (erased on transpile) |
| Type juggling / weak typing | all | Type system | Implicit scalar coercion (`"1" + 1`), `==` loose equality. `[RUNTIME]` | IMPORTANT — Phorge is strict; loose coercion is a semantic gap |
| `declare(strict_types=1)` | 7.0 (pre-8) | Type system | Per-file opt-in to strict scalar type enforcement. `[RUNTIME]` | IMPORTANT — only strict-typed PHP is cleanly importable |

---

## (2) Classes / OOP

| Feature | Version | Category | One-line semantics | Type-system relevance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Constructor property promotion | 8.0 | OOP | Declare + assign a property directly in the constructor signature. `[SUGAR]` (desugars to field + assignment) | core — Phorge already supports this |
| Late static binding (`static::`) | 5.3 (pre-8, ubiquitous) | OOP | `static::` resolves to the runtime (not declaring) class. `[RUNTIME]` | core — needed for `static` return type |
| Nullsafe method/prop access `?->` | 8.0 | OOP / control flow | Short-circuits the chain to `null` if the receiver is null. `[RUNTIME]` | core — Phorge `?.` maps directly |
| `::class` on objects | 8.0 | OOP | `$obj::class` yields the FQCN string. `[RUNTIME]` | aux |
| `enum` methods / interfaces / constants | 8.1 | OOP | Enums may implement interfaces, have methods & constants. `[RUNTIME]` | core |
| First-class callable syntax `f(...)` | 8.1 | OOP / functions | `strlen(...)`, `$obj->m(...)`, `C::m(...)` → a `Closure`. `[RUNTIME]` (produces a Closure value) | core — needs first-class function values |
| `final` class constants | 8.1 | OOP | Constants cannot be overridden in subclasses. `[RUNTIME]` | aux |
| `readonly` classes | 8.2 | OOP | (see Type system) all props immutable. `[RUNTIME]` | IMPORTANT |

| `#[\Override]` attribute | 8.3 | OOP | Compile-time assertion that a method overrides a parent. `[RUNTIME]` (engine check) | aux — checked-only, erasable |
| Readonly amendments (clone) | 8.3 | OOP | `readonly` props may be reinitialised during `__clone`. `[RUNTIME]` | aux |
| Property hooks (`get`/`set`) | 8.4 | OOP | Computed properties: inline `get`/`set` accessor bodies on a property. `[RUNTIME]` (accessor invocation) | IMPORTANT — accessor methods behind a field; needs hook lowering |
| Asymmetric visibility `public private(set)` | 8.4 | OOP | Read scope and write scope declared independently. `[RUNTIME]` | IMPORTANT — read/write visibility split |
| Lazy objects | 8.4 | OOP | Object created as a proxy; real init deferred to first access. `[RUNTIME]` (proxy + reflection) | UN-IMPORTABLE — proxy/reflection magic, no static analogue |
| `new C()->method()` without parens | 8.4 | OOP | Chain off a `new` expression without wrapping parentheses. `[SUGAR]` | none — parser sugar |
| `final` in constructor promotion | 8.5 | OOP | A promoted property may be declared `final`. `[RUNTIME]` | aux |
| Static property asymmetric visibility | 8.5 | OOP | Asymmetric read/write visibility on static properties. `[RUNTIME]` | aux |
| Clone-with `clone($o, [p => v])` | 8.5 | OOP | Clone an object while overriding named properties (with-er pattern for `readonly`). `[RUNTIME]` | IMPORTANT — functional immutable update; maps to Phorge "copy-with" |
| Abstract methods in traits | 8.0 | OOP | Traits may declare abstract methods with signatures enforced on the user. `[RUNTIME]` | aux |
| Interfaces with constants typed | 8.3 | OOP | (see typed class constants) | core |

---

## (3) Attributes / metadata

| Feature | Version | Category | One-line semantics | Type-system relevance |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| `#[\SensitiveParameter]` | 8.2 | Attributes | Redacts a parameter's value from stack traces. `[RUNTIME]` | none — diagnostics only, erasable |
| `#[\ReturnTypeWillChange]` | 8.1 | Attributes | Suppresses a tentative-return-type deprecation. `[RUNTIME]` | none — erasable |
| `#[\Override]` | 8.3 | Attributes | Asserts a method overrides a parent (compile error otherwise). `[RUNTIME]` | aux — checked, erasable |
| `#[\Deprecated(message, since)]` | 8.4 | Attributes | User-land deprecation of functions/methods/class-constants. `[RUNTIME]` (emits deprecation) | none — diagnostics, erasable |
| `#[\NoDiscard]` | 8.5 | Attributes | Warns if a function's return value is discarded; `(void)` cast suppresses. `[RUNTIME]` (engine warning) | aux — could map to a Phorge lint |
| Attributes on constants | 8.5 | Attributes | Class/global constants may carry attributes. `[RUNTIME]` | none — metadata |
| `#[\Override]` extended to properties | 8.5 | Attributes | `#[\Override]` now also applies to properties. `[RUNTIME]` | aux |

## (4) Functions / calls

| Feature | Version | Category | One-line semantics | Type-system relevance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Named arguments `f(name: $v)` | 8.0 | Functions | Pass arguments by parameter name, in any order. `[RUNTIME]` (call-site rebinding) | IMPORTANT — call-site name binding; needs parameter-name model |
| Variadics `...$args` | 5.6 (pre-8) | Functions | Collect trailing args into an array parameter. `[RUNTIME]` | core — list-collection |
| Argument unpacking `f(...$arr)` | 5.6 / 8.1 | Functions | Spread an array into positional args; 8.1 adds string-keyed (named) unpacking. `[RUNTIME]` | IMPORTANT — named-arg unpacking needs a string-key map (no-Map concern) |
| First-class callable `f(...)` | 8.1 | Functions | (see OOP) creates a `Closure` from any callable. `[RUNTIME]` | core |
| Arrow functions `fn() =>` | 7.4 (pre-8) | Functions | Single-expression closure with auto by-value capture. `[SUGAR]`-ish (auto-capture is `[RUNTIME]`) | core — Phorge Track A (S3) lambdas |
| Closures `function() use($x){}` | 5.3 (pre-8) | Functions | Anonymous function with explicit capture list (by-value or `&`-ref). `[RUNTIME]` | core (by-ref capture is UN-IMPORTABLE) |

| Trailing comma in `use` (closures) | 8.0 | Functions | Trailing comma allowed in closure `use()` lists. `[SUGAR]` | none |
| Partial function application `f(?, ...)` | 8.6 (accepted) | Functions | Placeholders (`?` single, `...` rest) create a `Closure` binding some args. `[RUNTIME]` (produces Closure) | core — needs first-class functions + currying-ish lowering |

---

## (5) Control flow / expressions

| Feature | Version | Category | One-line semantics | Type-system relevance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `match` expression | 8.0 | Control flow | Value-returning, strict-`===`, exhaustive-or-throws branch selector. `[RUNTIME]` | core — Phorge `match` maps directly |
| `throw` as expression | 8.0 | Control flow | `throw` usable in expression position (e.g. `?:`, arrow fn, `??`). `[RUNTIME]` | IMPORTANT — `throw` becomes an expression of bottom type `never` |
| Nullsafe operator `?->` | 8.0 | Control flow | Short-circuit member access on null receiver → null. `[RUNTIME]` | core — Phorge `?.` |
| Non-capturing catch `catch (E)` | 8.0 | Control flow | `catch` without binding a variable. `[SUGAR]` | none |
| `??` null-coalescing | 7.0 (pre-8) | Control flow | Left value unless null, else right. `[RUNTIME]` | core — Phorge `??` |
| `??=` null-coalescing assignment | 7.4 (pre-8) | Control flow | Assign right only if left is null/unset. `[RUNTIME]` | aux |
| Pipe operator `\|>` | 8.5 | Control flow / expressions | `$x \|> f \|> g` feeds the left value as the single arg to the right callable. `[SUGAR]` (lowers to nested calls) | core — Phorge Track A pipe `\|>` maps directly |
| `list()` / `[$a,$b]` destructuring | 7.1 (pre-8) | Control flow | Positional + keyed array destructuring assignment. `[RUNTIME]` | aux — keyed destructuring touches the no-Map concern |

| Heredoc / Nowdoc (flexible, 7.3) | 7.3 (pre-8) | Values | Multi-line string literals; nowdoc is non-interpolating. `[RUNTIME]` (heredoc interpolates) | none |
| Octal explicit prefix `0o` | 8.1 | Values | `0o17` explicit-octal integer literal. `[SUGAR]` | none |
| `array_first()` / `array_last()` | 8.5 | Values / stdlib | First/last value of an array, or null if empty. `[RUNTIME]` | aux — list head/last |
| `array_is_list()` | 8.1 | Values / stdlib | True iff array is a 0-based contiguous list (vs associative map). `[RUNTIME]` | IMPORTANT — distinguishes List vs Map at runtime; key for the no-Map importer |

---

## (7) Error handling

| Feature | Version | Category | One-line semantics | Type-system relevance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `\Throwable` hierarchy (`\Error` vs `\Exception`) | 7.0 (pre-8, foundational) | Error handling | `\Throwable` is the root; `\Error` (engine) and `\Exception` (user) are the two trees. `[RUNTIME]` | IMPORTANT — Phorge faults are flat; exception subtyping needs a model |

## (8) Dynamic / un-importable features (flagged)

> Every row here is **UN-IMPORTABLE** into a static, immutable, no-Map language. See the

## Un-importable dynamic features — narrative summary

The PHP → Phorge importer must **reject (or refuse to faithfully model)** the following classes
of feature. They violate one of Phorge's three load-bearing invariants — **static shape**,
**immutability/acyclic heap**, or **no associative-Map primitive** — or rely on capabilities
Phorge deliberately omits (`eval`, reflection, global mutable state).

1. **Runtime-name resolution** — `$$x`, `$o->$prop`, `$o->$m()`, `$fn()`, `new $cls`,
   `constant($name)`, `extract`/`compact`. Names are not knowable statically → no binding,
   no type. (First-class callables `f(...)` and `Closure` values ARE importable — they carry
   a static identity; only *string-named* dynamic dispatch is rejected.)
2. **Metaprogramming & code-as-data** — `eval()`, the entire Reflection API, magic methods
   (`__get`/`__set`/`__isset`/`__unset`/`__call`/`__callStatic`), lazy objects. The object
   shape and behaviour are not statically determinable.
3. **Mutation & aliasing** — references (`&$x`, by-ref params, by-ref `foreach`, `use (&$x)`),
   `static $x` locals, `global`/`$GLOBALS`. Phorge's heap is immutable + acyclic; aliasing and
   hidden persistent state have no representation.
4. **The associative-array-as-everything idiom** — PHP's single `array` is list + map + struct +
   set. Phorge has a typed `List` but **no Map primitive**. Only the list-shaped subset
   (`array_is_list($a) === true`) imports cleanly; string-keyed / mixed-key arrays, named-arg
   unpacking from assoc arrays, and `extract`/`compact` do not.
5. **Global mutable runtime state** — `set_error_handler`/`set_exception_handler`, superglobals,
   INI-driven behaviour switches.
6. **Weak typing semantics** — loose `==` and silent type juggling. Only `===`/`match`
   (strict) map to Phorge's strict equality; importing `==` would change program meaning.
7. **Unstructured control** — `goto`, backtick shell-exec (also deprecated in 8.5).

**Partially importable (shape-dependent):** constructor promotion, named args (need a
parameter-name model but are static), variadics, array destructuring (positional yes; keyed
touches the Map concern), arrow/closure functions (by-*value* capture importable; by-*ref*
capture is not).

---

## Sugar vs runtime semantics — quick index

**Pure syntactic sugar** (desugars to existing constructs, no new runtime behaviour):
constructor property promotion, `new C()->m()` without parens, trailing commas (params / `use`),
numeric separators `1_000`, octal `0o` prefix, non-capturing `catch`, the pipe `|>` operator
(lowers to nested calls), and arrow-function *syntax* (the auto-capture itself is runtime).

**Require real runtime/semantic support** (new engine behaviour): everything in the type-system
table (union/intersection/DNF/`never`/`readonly`/enums), property hooks, asymmetric visibility,
lazy objects, clone-with, named arguments (call-site rebinding), first-class callables &
partial application (Closure synthesis), `match` (strict + exhaustive throw), nullsafe `?->`,
`throw`-as-expression, `??`/`??=`, all attributes that emit warnings/deprecations
(`#[\NoDiscard]`, `#[\Deprecated]`), and every dynamic feature in section (8).
