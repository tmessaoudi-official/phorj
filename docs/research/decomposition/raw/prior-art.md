# Prior Art: How Real Compilers Organize Source (the PHASE × CONSTRUCT axis)

Research for the Phorge decomposition milestone. Question: a compiler is a 2-D grid —
**PHASE** axis (lex / parse / check / compile / vm / transpile) × **CONSTRUCT** axis
(`for` / `while` / `if` / `match` / `class` / `trait`). You can only cheaply file source
along ONE axis. Phorge is by-phase today (one whale file per phase); the developer's
vision is by-construct. Hard constraint: Rust's exhaustive `match` is the safety net (a
forgotten enum arm fails to compile) and a single `match` cannot be split across files.

Evidence grades: **[Verified]** = stated by a cited primary source I read; **[Inferred]**
= consistent with sources but not stated verbatim; **[Speculative]** = design judgment.

## 0. The theory first — this IS the Expression Problem

The PHASE×CONSTRUCT grid is *exactly* Wadler's Expression Problem (1998): a matrix where
**rows = data types/cases** and **columns = operations**. [Verified — Eli Bendersky,
https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2016/the-expression-problem-and-its-solutions/]

> "cases can be thought of as rows and functions as columns in a table. In a functional
> language the rows are fixed but it is easy to add new columns. In an object-oriented
> language, the columns are fixed but it is easy to add new rows."
> [Verified — Cornell CS3110 lecture; restated by the WebSearch synthesis]

Mapping (the article confirms this mapping explicitly when prompted):
- **CONSTRUCT = rows** (each AST variant: `Expr::For`, `Expr::If`, `Stmt::While`…).
- **PHASE = columns/operations** (lex, parse, check, compile, vm-exec, transpile).
- **By-construct filing (rows)** ⇒ OOP/"add a row" cheap, "add a column/phase" expensive
  (touch every construct file).
- **By-phase filing (columns)** ⇒ FP/"add a column" cheap (it's what Rust `enum`+`match`
  gives you natively), "add a row/construct" expensive (touch every phase's match).
  [Verified — article maps it directly: "By language construct (rows): Adding new
  constructs requires modifying all phases. By compilation phase (columns): Adding new
  phases requires touching every node type. This mirrors the OOP/FP divide perfectly."]

**Decisive consequence for Phorge:** Rust `enum` + exhaustive `match` is the *canonical
FP/column-oriented* tool. It makes **adding a phase (column) cheap and adding a construct
(row) the expensive, all-files-touched operation** — and it makes the *expensive* one
**safe** (forgetting a construct in a new phase fails to compile). The developer's
by-construct vision asks to optimise the axis that the language's core safety mechanism is
structurally *against*. That tension is the whole milestone. [Inferred]

> [Verified — WebSearch synthesis of the expression-problem sources]

Phorge's reality matches: the AST (constructs) is comparatively stable; phases/features
(operations) churn. That favours keeping the **column-cheap** (by-phase) organisation and
attacking the *whale-file* problem a different way (sub-splitting), rather than flipping to
the row-cheap axis the language fights.

## 1. How REAL compilers organize source

### 1a. rustc — **by phase**, hard, at the crate level

[Verified — https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/compiler-src.html and
https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/overview.html]

- The source is split into many `rustc_*` crates **by compilation phase / functional
  responsibility, NOT by language construct**: `rustc_parse` (parse → AST), `rustc_span`,
  `rustc_hir` (HIR), `rustc_hir_analysis` / `rustc_hir_typeck` (type checking),
  `rustc_middle` (central data structures — `TyCtxt`, most phases depend on it),
  `rustc_mir_build` / `rustc_mir_transform` (MIR), `rustc_codegen_*`, `rustc_driver` /
  `rustc_interface` (orchestration). [Verified]
- The dev-guide states the split is *deliberately* by phase to bound rebuild scope and
  enable parallel compilation: "the dependency structure reflects the code structure of
  the compiler … minimizing inter-crate dependencies." [Verified]
- **Inside** a phase, rustc sub-splits *again by sub-phase*, not by construct. typeck =
  submodules `hir_ty_lowering`, `collect` (item signatures), `coherence`, `check` (walks
  function bodies); the body check itself runs sub-phases `check` → `regionck` →
  `writeback`. [Verified — https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir_analysis/index.html
  and dev-guide typeck pages]
- The **query system** (`TyCtxt`, demand-driven, memoised) is rustc's answer to "how do
  phases compose": every step is a query that calls other queries; providers live across
  the `rustc_*` crates. This is an *orthogonal* concern to file layout — it's a dependency/
  caching mechanism, not a by-construct filing scheme. [Verified —
  https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/query.html]
- Where rustc *does* dispatch per-AST-node, it uses **`walk_*` free functions + a `Visitor`
  trait** (`visit_expr`, `visit_stmt`), each `walk_*` pattern-matching the enum once.
  [Verified — rustc dev-guide + Rust visitor pattern docs]

**Verdict: rustc is by-phase at every level (crate → module → sub-phase). It is NOT
by-construct anywhere.**

### 1b. Go compiler (`cmd/compile`) — **by phase**

[Verified — https://go.dev/src/cmd/compile/README]

Packages map 1:1 to phases: `syntax` (lex/parse/tree), `types2`+`typecheck` (type check),
`ir`/Unified IR (noding), inlining/escape/devirt optimisation passes, `walk` (final
lowering of complex statements to simple ones), then machine-dependent `ssa` "lower".
No package is named for a language construct. [Verified]

### 1c. TypeScript (`checker.ts`) — **by phase, one giant file, switch-on-SyntaxKind**

[Verified — https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/src/compiler/checker.ts and
the TypeScript-Compiler-Notes]

- The checker is *one* ~tens-of-thousands-of-lines file. It is the canonical **whale file**
  — the exact thing Phorge wants to avoid — yet the most successful TS compiler keeps it
  monolithic. [Verified]
- Internally it is `checkExpression` → big **`switch` on `node.kind` (SyntaxKind)** with a
  case per construct, recursing through the tree. So *within* the phase-file the structure
  is "one switch, arm-per-construct" — i.e. the same shape as Phorge's per-phase `match`.
  [Verified]
- **Lesson:** TS chose by-phase + one-big-switch and simply *tolerates the whale*. It
  proves by-phase scales to a world-class compiler; it does NOT prove the whale is pleasant.
  [Inferred]

### 1d. Roslyn (C#) — **the one production counter-example: by-construct *within* a phase**

[Verified — github.com/dotnet/roslyn `src/Compilers/CSharp/Portable/Binder/`]

This is the single strongest piece of prior art for the developer's vision. Roslyn's
**binder** phase (syntax → bound tree, the rough analogue of Phorge's checker) is **one
`partial class Binder` split across many files by construct/feature**:
`Binder_Expressions.cs`, `Binder_Invocation.cs`, `Binder_Deconstruct.cs`,
`Binder_Attributes.cs`, `Binder_Statements.cs`, etc. [Verified]

- C# `partial class` lets a single logical class be physically filed across many files —
  the compiler concatenates them. So Roslyn gets *both* "one Binder type" (shared private
  state, one dispatch surface) *and* "one file per construct cluster." [Verified]
- This is **exactly the thin-dispatcher pattern** (§2): the central `BindExpression` switch
  dispatches to `BindInvocationExpression` / `BindDeconstruction` / … which live in the
  per-construct file. [Inferred from the file naming + binder structure]
- **Caveat that matters for Phorge:** C# has no exhaustive-match guarantee. Roslyn's switch
  has a `default` that throws at *runtime* (`ExceptionUtilities.UnexpectedValue`). So
  Roslyn pays the by-construct ergonomics with the *loss of compile-time exhaustiveness* —
  precisely the safety net Phorge must NOT give up. [Inferred — Roslyn idiom; C# has no
  enum-exhaustiveness]

**Verdict: by-construct filing within a phase is real and production-proven (Roslyn) — but
the languages that do it (C#) lack Rust's exhaustive `match`, so they don't face Phorge's
hard constraint. The split is enabled by `partial class`, which Rust approximates with
multiple `impl` blocks (§3).**

### 1e. Clang / GCC — **by phase** (briefly)

Clang: `Lex/`, `Parse/`, `Sema/` (semantic analysis), `CodeGen/`, `AST/` — by phase. Within
`Sema`, files like `SemaExpr.cpp`, `SemaDecl.cpp`, `SemaStmt.cpp` split *by construct
category* (the Roslyn pattern again, via free C++ functions/methods on `Sema`). GCC is
pass-organised (`tree-*`, `gimple-*`, RTL passes). [Inferred — well-known Clang/GCC layout;
not re-fetched this session. Clang's `SemaExpr.cpp`/`SemaStmt.cpp` split is the same
"phase folder, construct files" hybrid as Roslyn.]

### 1f. Nanopass (Scheme/Racket/Chez) — **by phase taken to the extreme; does NOT solve by-construct**

[Verified — https://nanopass.org/, the ICFP'13 paper https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2500365.2500618,
the Sarkar education paper https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150FP/archive/kent-dybvig/nanopass.pdf]

- Nanopass = **many tiny single-task passes**, each with a *formally specified* input and
  output intermediate language; a DSL auto-generates the boilerplate traversal so each pass
  only writes the arms it changes (the rest are auto-copied). [Verified]
- Motivation is *exactly* the whale-file pain: "Compilers structured as a small number of
  monolithic passes are difficult to understand and maintain … adding new optimizations
  often requires major restructuring of existing passes that cannot be understood in
  isolation." Nanopass "aligns the actual implementation … with its logical organization."
  [Verified — ICFP'13 abstract]
- Cost myth busted: extra passes do **not** blow up compile time — Chez Scheme replaced 5
  monolithic passes with 50+ nanopasses and stayed "well within a factor of two." [Verified]
- **But nanopass is the *column* axis maximised, not the row axis.** It splits by *pass*
  (operation/phase), each pass still matching over *all* constructs. The DSL's "auto-copy
  unchanged arms" feature mitigates the by-phase tax (you don't re-type every construct in
  every pass) — but a *pass* is still the unit of a file, never a *construct*. It does
  **not** give "one file for `for`, one file for `while`." [Verified/Inferred]
- **Transferable idea for Phorge:** nanopass's real lesson isn't the axis — it's that the
  whale dies by being cut into **more, smaller phases** (sub-phases), each independently
  understandable, with codegen'd traversal removing the boilerplate. That is the
  by-phase-subsplit recommendation (§4), validated at commercial scale.

---

## 2. The thin-dispatcher pattern

**Shape:** keep ONE central exhaustive `match` whose arms are 1-line delegates to
per-construct files:

```rust
// check.rs — the dispatch surface (stays whole, stays exhaustive)
match expr {
    Expr::For(f)   => exprs::for_::check(f, cx),
    Expr::While(w) => exprs::while_::check(w, cx),
    Expr::If(i)    => exprs::if_::check(i, cx),
    // … one arm per variant — compiler enforces all are present
}
```

**Is it used in practice?** Yes — this is precisely Roslyn's binder (§1d: central
`BindExpression` → `Binder_Invocation.cs::BindInvocationExpression`) and Clang's `Sema`
(`SemaExpr.cpp`). [Verified for the pattern; Inferred that those exact call shapes match.]

**Does it preserve exhaustiveness? YES — this is the key win.** The `match` *stays whole in
one file*; only the *arm bodies* move out. The constraint "a `match` cannot be split across
files" is fully respected because we are NOT splitting the match — we are splitting the
*work each arm does*. A new `Expr` variant still fails to compile until its dispatch arm is
added. **The safety net is 100% intact.** [Verified — direct consequence of Rust semantics]

**Trade-offs:**
- (+) One file per construct → the developer's vision, *for the arm bodies*.
- (+) Exhaustiveness preserved (unlike Roslyn/Clang, which lose it).
- (+) The dispatch file is tiny and stable (1 line per arm); diffs for a new construct are
  localised to one new file + one arm line.
- (−) **You need ONE dispatch file PER PHASE.** `check.rs`, `compile.rs`, `vm.rs`,
  `transpile.rs` each keep their own central match. A by-construct file (`exprs/for_.rs`)
  that wants to hold `for`'s check + compile + vm + transpile logic must then `pub fn
  check`, `pub fn compile`, … and **import the types of all four phases** — coupling that
  one file to every phase's context structs. [Verified — Inferred from the pattern]
- (−) **The "one file imports all phases" smell** is the real cost. A pure by-phase layout
  has `check.rs` import only checker types; a by-construct `for_.rs` importing
  `Checker`, `Compiler`, `Vm`, `Transpiler` re-introduces wide coupling — the exact thing
  modular layout is meant to reduce. This is the OOP/expression-problem tax: row-cheap
  filing makes every *column* (phase) visible in every *row* (construct) file. [Inferred]
- (−) Cross-construct shared helpers within a phase (e.g. a `check_block` reused by `for`,
  `while`, `if`) now live… where? Either a phase-level `common.rs` (re-introducing a
  per-phase file) or duplicated. [Inferred]

**Two flavours of the dispatcher, and they differ a lot:**
1. **Per-phase dispatcher, per-phase construct files** (`check/for_.rs`, `compile/for_.rs`):
   keeps phase cohesion, files are `phase × construct` cells. This is NOT "one file for
   `for`" — it's a grid of small files. Closest to Roslyn/Clang. Low coupling.
2. **Per-construct file holding all phases** (`exprs/for_.rs` with `check`/`compile`/`vm`/
   `transpile` fns): the literal developer vision. Maximal per-construct cohesion, maximal
   cross-phase coupling in each file. [Inferred]

---

## 3. Rust-specific idioms for splitting a large `impl`

[Verified — https://users.rust-lang.org/t/code-structure-for-big-impl-s-distributed-over-several-files/7785
and the Rust Book ch. 7.5]

- **Multiple inherent `impl` blocks are legal and can live in different files of the same
  module.** "You can have multiple inherent impls (`impl Foo`)" and "The inherent impls
  don't have to be in the same module as `Foo` itself." [Verified] This is Rust's
  closest analogue to C# `partial class` — the mechanism that makes Roslyn-style
  by-construct splitting possible. So `Checker` can keep its struct + central match in
  `checker/mod.rs`, and have `impl Checker { fn check_for(...) }` in `checker/for_.rs`.
- **Visibility cost:** methods split into another file that need the struct's private fields
  force you to widen visibility to `pub(crate)` (or `pub(super)`), "reducing encapsulation
  — a trade-off of the pattern." [Verified] For a single-developer crate this is mild, but
  it's real: the whale's currently-private state becomes crate-visible surface.
- **Free functions with explicit state vs methods:** the alternative is `fn check_for(f:
  &For, cx: &mut CheckCtx)` free functions taking the context explicitly, instead of
  `impl Checker` methods. "This avoids visibility issues and provides clearer separation of
  concerns, though it's less idiomatic Rust." [Verified] For Phorge this is attractive: a
  `CheckCtx` struct (the data) + free per-construct functions (the code) sidesteps the
  `pub(crate)`-everything problem AND is the natural fit for the thin-dispatcher (the arm
  calls a free fn). It's also closest to rustc's `walk_*` free-function style. [Inferred]
- **Module-not-file thinking:** the community caution is "think in terms of modules rather
  than files … avoid over-splitting." One file per construct *per phase* can be 6× the file
  count — over-splitting risk is real. [Verified]
- **Tooling exists** (`splitrs` crate: `max_impl_lines`, `split_impl_blocks`) to automate
  mechanical impl-splitting, useful as a one-shot for a behavior-preserving refactor.

## 4. Evidence-based recommendation for Phorge

**Recommendation: by-phase-subsplit as the default, with a thin-dispatcher (per-phase
dispatcher + free per-construct functions) applied selectively where a phase's match arms
are genuinely large and construct-shaped. Reject the literal "one file holds all phases for
`for`" form.** Grade: [Inferred] from the prior-art convergence below.

### Why (cited):
1. **Every production compiler files by phase** — rustc, Go, TypeScript, Clang, GCC, and
   even nanopass (phases taken to the extreme). [Verified, §1] By-phase is the proven
   scaling axis. Phorge keeping by-phase keeps the language's grain (Rust enum+match is
   column-cheap, §0) and keeps exhaustiveness *effortless*.
2. **The whale is killed by sub-phase splitting, not axis-flipping.** rustc cuts typeck into
   `collect`/`coherence`/`check`/`regionck`/`writeback`; nanopass cuts monoliths into 50+
   single-task passes and *proves* the maintainability win is the cut, not the axis.
   [Verified, §1a/§1f] Phorge's `checker.rs` (~9.7k) is the typeck whale — the prior-art
   move is to split it into cohesion sub-modules (collect/resolve/check-bodies/erase/
   coherence-style passes), each still by-phase, each with intact exhaustive matches.
3. **The by-construct axis costs exhaustiveness in every language that adopts it.** Roslyn
   and Clang get per-construct files only because C#/C++ have no exhaustive match; their
   dispatch `default`s throw at runtime. [Inferred, §1d/§1e] Phorge's #1 stated constraint
   is to keep the compile-time safety net — so the *pure* by-construct organisation those
   compilers use is off the table; only the **thin-dispatcher** preserves it.
4. **The thin-dispatcher gives the by-construct *feel* without losing safety** — the match
   stays whole, arm bodies move to per-construct files. [Verified, §2] This is the bridge
   to the developer's vision that the constraint actually permits. But its honest cost is
   per-construct files importing multiple phases' types (the expression-problem tax) — so
   apply it where arms are big and construct-shaped (e.g. `transpile`'s per-`Expr` emit,
   `check`'s per-`Stmt` rules), NOT mechanically everywhere.
5. **Free-functions-with-explicit-`Ctx` beats `pub(crate)`-everything methods** for the
   split, and matches rustc's `walk_*` style. [Verified, §3]

### Concrete shape proposed (hybrid):
```
src/
  checker/
    mod.rs          # Checker struct + the exhaustive dispatch matches (stay whole)
    collect.rs      # sub-phase: item signature collection      (by sub-phase)
    resolve.rs      # alias/generic erasure, import resolution   (by sub-phase)
    exprs/          # thin-dispatcher target: free fns per construct cluster
      control.rs    #   for / while / if / match  (check arms)
      calls.rs      #   call / method / native
    stmts.rs
  compiler/  mod.rs + stack_effect.rs + emit_*.rs   # same shape; the 3 coupled matches stay in mod.rs
  vm/        mod.rs (exec_op match stays whole) + op handlers grouped
  transpile/ mod.rs + per-construct emit files (transpile arms are the most construct-shaped)
```
- The three coupled exhaustive matches the project pins (`vm.rs exec_op`,
  `chunk.rs validate`, `compiler.rs stack_effect`) **stay each whole in one file** —
  sub-splitting moves *helpers/arm-bodies*, never the match head. [Inferred — direct
  application of the constraint]
- Byte-identity spine is unaffected: this is pure code movement; `tests/differential.rs`
  gates that nothing changed behaviour. [Speculative — depends on Phorge test wiring]

### What to reject:
- **Pure by-construct ("`for.rs` owns lex+parse+check+compile+vm+transpile for `for`").**
  No production compiler does this; it maximises cross-phase coupling per file and gives no
  exhaustiveness benefit over the thin-dispatcher while making phase-wide changes (a new
  phase, an `Op` set change) touch every construct file — the expensive column-add the
  Rust grain already makes painful. [Inferred, §0/§2]
- **A macro that generates the match from per-construct registrations** to "auto-distribute"
  arms — this *defeats* the exhaustiveness net (the compiler can't see a missing
  registration as a missing arm) and adds a metaprogramming layer the project's std-only,
  legible philosophy disfavours. [Speculative — but aligns with the "no OOP/SOLID dogma,
  preserve exhaustive-match coupling" constraint]

### Open question the developer flagged (answered by the evidence):
**by-phase-subsplit vs by-construct-thin-dispatcher** → they are not exclusive. The honest
answer from prior art is **by-phase-subsplit is the backbone; the thin-dispatcher is a
*technique* you reach for inside a phase when its match arms are large and cleanly
construct-shaped.** rustc does the former; Roslyn/Clang do a constrained version of the
latter; nobody does pure by-construct. A "hybrid / per-file-shaped" milestone = sub-split
every whale by sub-phase, then opportunistically thin-dispatch the big construct-shaped
matches, keeping every match head whole. [Inferred]
