# M-Lift — PHP → Phorge (`phg lift`) Plan

> The reverse of `transpile`: read PHP, emit a Phorge **draft**. A new front-end subsystem. Scoped as
> a **best-effort, review-required** tool — NOT a verified-equivalent transform (see the verdict below).

## Verdict / Decisions Log
- [2026-06-25] AGREED: **Pursue it** — but framed correctly. Build a bounded best-effort tool, not a
  100%-confidence transpiler.
- [2026-06-25] AGREED: **Name = `lift`** (`phg lift foo.php` → `foo.phg`). NOT "transpile" — that name
  carries the byte-identity guarantee the reverse direction cannot have (false promise, like the
  rejected `composer.json`). Asymmetry of names mirrors asymmetry of guarantees: transpile *down*
  (total, verified) vs lift *up* (partial, review-required). Alternatives considered: `port`/`import`.
- [2026-06-25] AGREED: **100% confidence is impossible in general** (fundamental, not an engineering
  gap): the languages aren't bijective (Phorge = strict/typed/smaller; PHP = dynamic/larger), type
  inference from untyped PHP is undecidable + lossy (`array` ⇒ List|Map|Set), and no spine runs
  backward. Same reason no 100% JS→TS converter exists. So: best-effort + human-in-the-loop, honest
  boundaries.
- [2026-06-25] AGREED: **Tier-1 first, demo-angle first.** Highest value-per-effort + the "show what
  PHP becomes in Phorge" use case (playground "paste PHP → see Phorge").
- [2026-06-25] OPEN (ask before build): demo angle (smaller, playground-first) vs migration angle
  (bigger, needs the round-trip gate) as the primary driver — they share the parser but differ in depth.

## Feasibility tiers (what `lift` handles)
| Tier | PHP shape | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Already Phorge-shaped: typed signatures (PHP 7/8 hints), typed class props, `enum` (8.1), `match`, plain control flow, arrays | High (near 1:1 backward) |
| **2** | Untyped-but-inferrable; `array` whose List/Map role is clear from use | Medium (heuristic + checker validation) |
| **3** | Dynamic PHP (`$$x`, `eval`, magic methods, reflection, true `mixed`) | **Refuse + flag** `// CANNOT LIFT: <reason>`, never guess |

## Phases (slices)
| Phase | Work | Size |
|---|---|---|
| **L1** | PHP lexer (std-only) for the Tier-1 token set | S–M |
| **L2** | **PHP parser, Tier-1 subset** (typed fn sigs, classes + typed props + promotion, `enum`, `match`, `if`/`for`/`foreach`/`while`, exprs, array literals) | **L — dominant cost; rivals Phorge's own parser** |
| **L3** | Phorge AST → `.phg` **pretty-printer** (does not exist yet; the transpiler prints PHP, not Phorge) | M |
| **L4** | **Lifter**: PHP-AST → Phorge-AST. Map typed PHP 1:1; infer `List`/`Map`/`Set` from `array` usage; map `?T`→`T?`, `??`/`?->`; flag dynamic features as `// CANNOT LIFT`. | M–L |
| **L5** | **Round-trip differential gate** + confidence annotations: `lift` PHP→Phorge, `transpile` back→PHP, run BOTH PHPs on sample inputs, compare stdout. Match = evidence the lift preserved behavior. Annotate output `// lifted (verify)`. | M |
| **L6** | `phg lift` CLI + **playground "paste PHP → see Phorge" demo** | S–M |

## Contract (lock before build)
- **Review-required**: output is a draft/scaffold, never a verified equivalent.
- **Annotates confidence**: `// lifted (verify)` on lifted code; `// CANNOT LIFT: <reason>` on Tier-3.
- **Refuses Tier-3 loudly** rather than guessing.
- **Round-trip-gated** (L5) as the quality signal — confidence is *earned and visible*, like the rest
  of Phorge, not claimed.
- The Phorge type-checker validates the lifted draft: if it type-checks, it's structurally sound
  (behavior still needs review).

## Effort
~15–25 gated slices ≈ a major milestone. The PHP parser (L2) dominates. Roughly **3–4× Track 1**.
Start at L1–L3 + a thin Tier-1 lifter behind the playground demo; grow the parser incrementally.

## Dependencies / sequencing
- **After Track 1** (transpile modernization): a clean native-PHP printer makes the L5 round-trip
  comparison far easier to validate.
- L3 (Phorge printer) is independently useful (e.g. `phg fmt` could reuse it later).

## Decisions Log (build)
- [2026-06-25] AGREED: **demo angle first** (playground "paste PHP → see Phorge"). Tier-1 PHP
  subset, thin lifter, `// lifted (verify)` annotations; L5 round-trip optional this phase. Build
  L1 (PHP lexer) → L2 (Tier-1 parser) → L3 (Phorge pretty-printer) → L4 (thin lifter) → L6 (CLI +
  playground demo). Module lives at `src/lift/`.

## Progress
- [2026-06-25] **L1 COMPLETE** (`2f4ee27`): `src/lift/` module + std-only Tier-1 PHP lexer
  (`src/lift/lexer.rs` — `PTok` enum, `lex_php`, `PTokenSpanned` with line tracking), 7 tests green.
  Out-of-tier input (backtick, unterminated string/comment, bare `$`) → loud `lift lex error`,
  never a guess. No backend touched.
- **NEXT = L2** — Tier-1 PHP parser (`src/lift/parser.rs`): typed fn sigs, classes + typed props +
  ctor promotion, `enum`, `match`, `if`/`for`/`foreach`/`while`, exprs, array literals → a PHP AST.
  The dominant M-Lift slice.
