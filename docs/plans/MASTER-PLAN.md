# PHORJ MASTER PLAN — the ONE unified roadmap (cursor + live percentage + all tracked work)

> **This is the living plan and the single forward SSOT.** Unified 2026-07-03 by the Stage-D
> consolidation of the full unification audit: it replaces BOTH the 2026-07-02 MASTER-PLAN and
> `wave0-remainder.plan.md` (superseded, archived after review; full prior text in git history at
> `0691228`). It absorbs: the 2026-07-02 full-audit roadmap (waves 0–6, §12 rulings ledger), the
> wave-0-remainder session decisions, and the **2026-07-03 unification audit** (61 findings,
> 4 buckets, 17 developer-ruled decisions — synthesis at
> `docs/research/2026-07-03-unification-audit/SYNTHESIS.md`, raw reports A1–A10 alongside it).
>
> **Spec SSOT:** the frozen per-topic specs were folded into ONE spec —
> `docs/specs/UNIFIED-SPEC.md` (ruled 2026-07-03). Every "the X spec" reference below means the
> relevant section of UNIFIED-SPEC; the original per-file texts are in git history.
> Decisions register: `docs/research/full-audit/raw/C-decisions.md` (canonical, 141 rows).
> Delivery rules: `/stack/projects/phorj/CLAUDE.md` + `docs/INVARIANTS.md` — read both first.

## 0. CURSOR — WHERE WE ARE (update this block every working session)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Date / HEAD** | 2026-07-04 (later) · **FORK-BACKLOG ADJUDICATION PASS COMPLETE + Wave A starting.** Prior marathon (`f8b8cd1`) pushed by developer. This session cleared ALL open §15 forks interactively (§13.1 / DEC-177…181): trait BLESSED, W3-5 blocker→Wave A, error model→honor-3-tier, editors→LSP-first-then-native, UA-1.8 shape. Only W4-10 XML deferred. Rulings merged into this plan + `C-decisions.md`; temp session plan removed (one-SSOT rule). **NOW BUILDING Wave A (Type-System Completion).** — prior-run note below: **AUTONOMOUS MARATHON — 18 green commits `b3bd402`→`7e5c389`, all full-oracle-gate verified (1661 tests, php-8.5.8), unpushed. Clean checkpoint: all CLEAR/unambiguous high-value work done; remaining items need the developer (design/§15/fresh-session) or are P2-with-investigation.** DONE this run: **M0** — examples.js determinism, mold, --help fixes (UA-0.2/0.3/0.4), 18 specs archived+repointed, UA-0.6 (E-STATIC-FIELD-VIA-INSTANCE diagnostic), UA-0.17 (2 ghost explain drops), UA-0.18 (Suspend doc), UA-0.14-partial (Core.String stale-ASCII fix + String.length/List.append disclosures), nextest restored · **M1** — all small/medium byte-identity fixes (UA-1.1 trim, 1.2 reverse, 1.3 pbkdf2, 1.4 hmac→bytes, 1.7 clamp) + UA-1.8-part1 (fault-string names) + 1.9 import example + 1.10 playground forbid · **M5** — editor refresh (VSCode 0.3.0 + PhpStorm no-build path confirmed working). Deferred w/ evidence: UA-0.1 (nextest was the real lever). Recorded PENDING/couplings: PhpStorm native plugin (scope), UA-1.6↔W3-5 (expected-type→literal threading — build once, unblock both). **NEXT (developer/fresh-context): UA-1.8 part-2 shapes (pick canonical format), UA-1.5 (→ retirement, NO bulk sed), M2 UA-L2 (prelude/loader unification — design pass, gates W3), M3 web spine (W3-5 §15 {}-grammar blocker first); P2 tail UA-0.5/0.7/0.9/0.10/0.11/0.13/0.15/0.16.** — original run note below. |
| **(prior)** | **AUTONOMOUS MARATHON IN PROGRESS (§2.7)**. Commits this run: `b3bd402` (examples.js determinism regen) · `b77e50e` (M0 UA-0.2 mold + UA-0.3 --help examples + UA-0.4 lsp/debug help parity) · `6217698` (M0 archive 18 folded specs + repoint live pointers to UNIFIED-SPEC) · `58d7355` (M1 UA-1.3 pbkdf2 u64 — silent-truncation/byte-identity fix, oracle-verified) · `80e93d9` (M5 editor refresh — VSCode grammar current + 0.3.0, dead verbs, PhpStorm no-build path confirmed) · `93628ef` (M1 UA-1.4 Hash.hmac→bytes, breaking, oracle-verified) · `d3d18bc` (M1 UA-1.7 Math.clamp faults on lo>hi — `__phorj_clamp` throwing helper mirrors `__phorj_gcd`; agree_err + selftest/faults capture; full oracle gate 1661 green). Also restored `cargo-nextest` (gate speed) + deferred UA-0.1 with evidence (§2.1). UA-1.6 found coupled to W3-5 (do together — §2.2 row). Then `ab5d398` (M1 UA-1.2 String.reverse by code point) · `e97f2d1` (M1 UA-1.1 trim/trimStart/trimEnd strip Rust's Unicode White_Space set — PCRE `/u` helpers, exact class verified byte-for-byte; ships string-unicode-ws.phg). **ALL small/medium M1 byte-identity fixes DONE: UA-1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4/1.7.** Remaining M1: UA-1.8 (fault-canon ~40-string sweep — canonical shape established by 1.7's `Math.clamp: …`; broad-but-mechanical), UA-1.6 (DEFERRED, coupled to W3-5 expected-type→literal threading), UA-1.9 (import-discipline example — cheap), UA-1.10 (playground forbid-unsafe — quick), UA-1.5 (→ retirement, fresh session). Then M2 (UA-L2 gates W3) / M3 web spine (XL). Gotcha logged: an unclassified native fault classifies to `Other(<msg incl. line>)`, so its agree_err program must keep the faulting call OUT of `"{…}"` interpolation (W0-5 VM line-skew would break the string compare). **Findings: three plan premises were stale (fresher than the plan** — UA-0.1 fmt fan-out already shipped; VSCode grammar ~95% already-current; PhpStorm no-build path already documented+working). Tree clean; several commits ahead of origin — push developer-gated, never autonomous. Gate green on **php-8.5.8** (oracle path in `scripts/toolchain.env`). |
| **Completion** | **PHP-parity ≈ 59%** (domain-weighted 35 SYN / 40 FN-usage-weighted / 25 RT; raw row floor ≈39%) · **Vision ≈ 61%** (70% parity + 30% programme) — denominator = the M-gap-matrix **824 verdict rows** (665 net of N/A + GAP-by-design). [Inferred: 2026-07-03 FN re-score of the ratified 2026-07-02 model — row flips shown in §11.2; full 824-row re-pass due at next milestone close] |
| **Current phase** | **FORK BACKLOG CLEARED (2026-07-04, §13.1 / DEC-177…181).** All open §15 adjudications resolved interactively (only W4-10 XML deferred). **NOW STARTING the feature marathon at Wave A** (Type-System Completion). Each step: gate-green (php-8.5.8 oracle) + Invariant-9 example + both-editor LSP support + commit; NEVER push. Keep THIS cursor current every working session (developer standing rule). |
| **Actively in progress** | **Wave A slice 1 = PRIMITIVE `match` type-patterns → ✅ SHIPPED + COMMITTED `292b64f` (full oracle gate green, php-8.5.8).** Float discrimination (incl. whole-number `4.0`→`float`, the byte-identity hazard) verified + in the differential harness. `match (x) { int i => …, string s => …, bool b => … }` on a `int\|string\|bool` union now type-checks, is compiler-EXHAUSTIVE, and is byte-identical run≡runvm≡PHP (→ `is_int`/`is_float`/`is_string`/`is_bool`/`is_null`). Discriminable set = int/float/string/bool/null; `decimal`/`bytes`/`html`/`attr` rejected (`E-MATCH-TYPE-ERASED`) + `string`-over-erased-union rejected (`E-MATCH-ERASED-AMBIG`) — byte-identity-forced. 4 sites edited (checker `matches.rs` + VM `exec.rs` IsInstance NO-NEW-OP + interpreter `mod.rs` + transpile `matches.rs`) + 3 `phg explain` entries + example `guide/union-narrowing.phg`. BONUS: `for (int\|string x in list)` + `match` narrowing works too (union-element collection ITERATION unlocked). **Wave A slice 2 → ✅ SHIPPED + COMMITTED `fc89e5d` (full oracle gate green, 1677 tests, php-8.5.8).** Finding (advisor-checked): union-element collection METHODS *already* resolve to the union — `.filter`→`List<A\|B>`, `.map`→`List<U>`, `.first`→`(A\|B)?` all thread the element union via the shipped generic unifier (`unify`→`apply_subst`), consumed today via a `null`-arm smart-cast or a `_`. Slice 2 therefore ships: (a) a **byte-identity FIX** — the `E-MATCH-ERASED-AMBIG` string-erasure guard was BLIND to `Optional(Union)` (`(string\|decimal)?` matched by `string` diverged run/runvm=`other` vs PHP=`str:…`, a G-1 hole); now unwraps `Optional` (`union_members_of`); (b) the first coverage for union-element methods — 3 checker tests + runnable `examples/guide/union-collections.phg` (byte-identical run≡runvm≡PHP). The flat wildcard-free `match` over `T?` was surfaced as a §15 FORK → **developer ruled Option A (DEC-183)** → shipped as **slice 2b `51c580e`** (`Optional<T>` = `T\|null` for match exhaustiveness; `Optional<enum>` still needs `_` — caveat, verified run≡runvm≡PHP in both emitter paths; full gate 1684). **Wave A slice 3 = ✅ SHIPPED (3a `c417196` + 3b `96377eb`, full gate 1692 green).** **DEC-184: FULL SYMMETRY** — `is` and `instanceof` are interchangeable, both test/narrow primitives AND classes; both flow-narrow in `if`. **3a** = a shipped-latent-divergence FIX: `match { int i => i*2 }` (arithmetic on a match-narrowed primitive) ran on interp+PHP but compile-failed on the VM — the binding CTy was `Class("int")` not `Int`; new `cty_of_type_name` maps the discriminable head to its operand CTy (CTy-operand trap, Invariant 7). **3b** = the `is` operator + `instanceof`-over-primitives (parser contextual `is`, checker accepts primitives + erasure guard, interp primitive dispatch [was class-only], transpile `is_int`, then-branch narrowing in checker AND VM `compile_if`). **BOUND (ruled-symmetry dent, KNOWN_ISSUES + W2-12):** a PRIMITIVE narrows only in the direct THEN-branch — the union complement (else / union-minus-type / negated-early-return-tail) is NOT narrowed (a union local is opaque on the VM); dropped in the checker too so it's lockstep (both reject), not a divergence. Classes narrow both directions; `is null` narrows optionals. **Slice (4) W5-3 sealed hierarchies = ✅ SHIPPED + COMMITTED `0821d2b` (full gate 1698 green)** (NOT a §15 fork — MODEL SPECIFIED by XL-003 in `F-cross-language.md:45`: `sealed` keyword on class+interface, IMPLICIT whole-program implementor set ["None beyond a keyword" → no `permits`], front-end-only, ERASES at transpile). **Wave A is NOT fully closed:** the Map/Set`<A|B>` LITERAL expected-type threading (DEC-178/UA-1.6) remains — so the §11 824-row parity recompute (due at *wave* close) is deliberately NOT run yet; it runs when that last Wave-A item lands. Sealed built exactly per the plan below. **Minimal design (backends FROZEN):** `sealed`⇒sets `open=true` so extension (E-EXTEND-FINAL bypass) + transpile-non-final ride existing `open` machinery; the sealed flag's ONLY new effect = exhaustiveness. Sites: lexer `sealed`→TokenKind::Sealed; AST `sealed:bool` on ClassDecl+InterfaceDecl; parser modifier loop (allow on class AND interface, sealed-class sets open); collect stores the flag; **matches.rs: one new arm** `Ty::Named(base) if base sealed` → permitted set = concrete classes C with `is_subtype(C,base)` (+ base itself iff base is a concrete class) → reuse `report_union_nonexhaustive` (the slice-3b-extracted helper). Transpile: verify `sealed` erases (rides `open`, no leak). Scope-limiters (advisor): a permitted subtype being `open` doesn't break exhaustiveness (deeper subclass matches ancestor arm — skip Java non-sealed/permits-transitivity); reuses `emit_match` defensive-terminal-arm (same AST → byte-identity by construction). Example + tests + `phg explain`. Each: full differential + Invariant-9 example + both-editor LSP. Build mode = AUTONOMOUS MARATHON (commit each green slice, never push). **SIDE — Pages CI:** build SUCCEEDS (artifact created); failure is `deploy-pages@v5` backend-side ("Deployment failed, try again later" — NOT wasm-pack/source). Action: RE-RUN the failed job (likely transient / `cancel-in-progress`); no verified defect in the workflow YAML. |
| **Next up (in order)** | **THE WAVE SEQUENCE (post-fork-clearing, §2.7 A2.x): WAVE A** Type-System Completion — usable union-element collections (`List/Set/Map<A\|B>`) + primitive `match` patterns + primitive exhaustiveness + `is` flow-narrowing + **W5-3 sealed hierarchies** + faithful transpile (reuses M-RT S4 engine; folds UA-1.6). → **WAVE B** Error-Model Completion — **ship canonical injected `Core.Result<T,E>` + `Core.Option<T>`** (explicitly imported, DEC-182; `Option` distinct from built-in `T?`, explicit convert) + rich error enums + `Result` ergonomics/combinators + typed multi-catch (baseline SHIPPED) + **audit/reclassify faulting natives** + UA-1.8 canonicalization; faults stay uncatchable. → **WAVE C** `String.format`/sprintf (W3-5, unblocked by Wave A threading). → **WAVE D** web spine (biggest parity mover): UA-L2 prelude/loader unification (build) → W3-1 SQL DBAL → W3-2 HTTP. Cross-cutting: every feature → BOTH editors via `phg lsp` same-change. Deferred: W4-10 XML, UA-1.5 `->` retirement (mechanical fresh-session), UA-L7 Core.Dotenv (Wave-D adjacent). |
| **Open adjudications** | **BACKLOG CLEARED 2026-07-04 (§13.1, DEC-177…181).** Resolved: W3-5 blocker (→ Wave A expected-type threading), §7-OPEN `trait` (BLESSED w/ MI), error model (honor 3-tier), editors (LSP-first→full-native), UA-1.8 shape. **Open items: W4-10 XML design** (deferred to Wave-4 proximity — needs its own design proposal) + **NEW §13.2 PENDING (2026-07-04): flat wildcard-free `match` over `T?`** (exhaustive `Optional` — Wave A slice 2 surfaced it; recommended Option A, not ruled). Everything else RULED (§13/§13.1 + Appendix B). |
| **Gate** | `source scripts/toolchain.env && PHORJ_REQUIRE_PHP=1 cargo test --workspace` + clippy + fmt + release build (oracle php path = the single editable knob in `scripts/toolchain.env`, currently `php-8.5.8`). Pre-commit = Rust-only (`PHORJ_SKIP_PHP=1`); pre-push = full 8.5 oracle. |

**Percentage protocol:** re-run the M §4 arithmetic (824 rows, weights 35/40/25) after every
milestone/wave close (ratified rule, §12 ledger); update this cursor and §11 in the same commit.
Always quote the number with its weights and denominator. The GA-CHECKLIST's separate "≈57%" figure
was computed from a false premise (LSP-missing) and is retired (audit B3-5).

## 1. GOVERNANCE & STANDING RULES

**G-1 · Byte-identity spine.** `phg run` ≡ `phg runvm` ≡ transpiled PHP under a real `php` (floor
**8.5**, `PHORJ_REQUIRE_PHP=1` fails-not-skips): identical stdout AND failure behavior, every
program, every example; the interpreter is the reference oracle. Enforced by `tests/differential.rs`
(3308 lines — split tracked as W1-1) + `tests/conformance.rs`.

**G-1.1 · The concurrency exception (disclose wherever byte-identity is claimed).** Concurrency
(`spawn`/`Channel`/`Task`) is permanently outside the PHP oracle (DEC-133, ratified): `run ≡ runvm`
holds; the PHP leg is a hard error — **the shipped code is `E-CONCURRENCY-NO-PHP`** (the ledger's
"E-TRANSPILE-CONCURRENCY" was the pre-implementation name; audit B3-4 verified only
`E-CONCURRENCY-NO-PHP` exists — use it everywhere) — with explicit `--sequential-concurrency`
opt-in + warning. Until W5-13, fault *line numbers* inside interpolation also diverge on the VM
(disclosed, W0-5). The audit added four *undisclosed* byte-identity breaks — now tracked + ruled as
UA-1 (§2.2); each fix lands its adversarial differential case same-commit (UA-0.13).

**G-2 · Quality gate (green means ALL):** workspace tests + clippy (warnings deny) + fmt +
release build + the full PHP-oracle gate before claiming any feature done. Perf claims need
`phg benchmark` before/after; CI regression gate `scripts/perf-gate.sh`.

**G-3 · Backend invariants** (detail `docs/INVARIANTS.md`): new `Op` ⇒ the three coupled matches
same commit ("no new Op" is the front-end default); value kernels single-sourced; compile-time
sugar expanded pre-backend via `cli::check_and_expand`; reified operands thread ALL vm-compile
paths; CTy-operand trap (`expr + 1` case); scratch slots `self.height - 1` (two-in-one-expr case).

**G-4 · Decisions.** Canonical register `docs/research/full-audit/raw/C-decisions.md`; the
2026-07-02 adjudication ledger is Appendix B; the **2026-07-03 unification-audit rulings are §13**.
Protocol for future decisions: interactive AskUserQuestion, ≤4 per round, recommended option first,
every design question ships a concrete risk example. **NEW standing instruction (developer,
2026-07-03): when a "more correct" answer and a "PHP-familiar" answer diverge, present and
default-recommend the more-correct one — PHP-parity is not a tie-breaking bias.** (Pattern across
the audit gate: the developer consistently chose the thorough option over the cheap one.)

**G-5 · Examples ship with features** (definition of done): runnable `examples/` program
(differential-globbed) + README index entry, same change; CLI features get a walkthrough README;
faults → README capture; impure/quarantined follow the `pure:false` conventions.

**G-6 · Anti-regrowth size rule:** soft 800 / hard 1000 production lines per file, tracked
exemptions, `scripts/size-gate.sh` in CI (W1-6 — not yet built; 12 files currently over the hard
cap, tracked, not silent).

**G-7 · Honesty rules.** No silent scope drops (rejects live in Appendix A with reasons);
codemod items say "REPLACE, not add"; no public perf claim vs a dev-built PHP (the local PHP
oracle binary is a DEBUG+Xdebug build — any `--vs-php` number on this box is invalid until
W6-4/UA-0.10). The five doc false-claim families the audit found (zero-deps, `import type`,
dead CLI verbs, the wrong concurrency E-code, 🔲-on-shipped) are corrected in the Stage-D pass
(§2.3) and must never be reintroduced.

## 2. UNIFICATION-AUDIT EXECUTION PROGRAMME (2026-07-03) — the current work

> Source: `docs/research/2026-07-03-unification-audit/SYNTHESIS.md` (61 findings, severity-ranked,
> evidence-graded). Every Bucket-2 decision below was RULED interactively by the developer on
> 2026-07-03 (§13 Decisions Log). Nothing here is open to re-litigation; the only judgment left is
> execution sequencing, fixed below. This programme completes BEFORE autonomous marathons resume.

### 2.1 UA-0 · Bucket 1 — nineteen ready-to-execute fixes (no design ambiguity)

Ordered P1→P3. Each item is done when its acceptance evidence exists and the gate is green.

| # | Sev | Item (source) | Status |
|---|-----|---------------|--------|
| UA-0.1 | P1 | **Test-gate serialization** — **PREMISE STALE, remainder DEFERRED (2026-07-04, evidence below; not "done", per G-7).** (a) The fmt corpus test *already* fans out across all cores via `std::thread::scope` (`tests/fmt.rs:128-146`, added since the "111 s" measurement) — the sharding win is already banked. (b) `runtime::shipped_manual_example_runs_on_both_backends` is NOT a corpus monolith: it runs ONE example (`fib(30)`), compute-bound (~57 s, 2.7M tree-walk calls × run+runvm) — not shardable without weakening the shipped-example guard. (c) The persistent-worker refactor is confirmed low-ROI (97 µs/call × ~260 calls ≈ 25 ms against 46 s — noise) AND not safely buildable here: a persistent worker must receive *borrowed* closures over a channel, which needs `stacker`/unsafe — both blocked by `forbid(unsafe_code)` + no-new-deps. **The real lever is `cargo-nextest`** (one global -j16 pool across binaries vs cargo's serial-per-binary; handoff proves 228→118 s here) — wiped by the stack reload, restore attempted (from-source `cargo install`, prebuilt blocked by classifier). (B1-1) | ⏸ deferred |
| UA-0.2 | P1 | **Wire mold**: `/bin/mold` is installed, no `.cargo/config.toml` exists — add the gitignored machine-local config (CI has no mold). (B1-2) | ✅ `b77e50e` |
| UA-0.3 | P1 | **Fix broken `--help` examples**: `run`/`runvm`/`disassemble` examples fail verbatim (missing `package Main; import Core.Output;`) and teach `->` — fix + convert to `: void` (`src/cli/mod.rs:77,85,129` + arrow prose at `:52,201,638`, `src/main.rs:301`). First contact with the tool currently produces two errors. (B1-3; syntax half sequences with UA-1.5) | ✅ `b77e50e` |
| UA-0.4 | P1 | **Help-surface parity**: add `lsp` + `debug` to the long `--help` (terse usage lists 18 verbs, long help lists 16) + per-command help for both. (B1-4) | ✅ `b77e50e` |
| UA-0.5 | P2 | **6 golden diagnostic corpus cases** (E-METHOD-VISIBILITY, E-CTOR-VISIBILITY, E-INJECTED-TYPE-BARE, E-DUP-FIELD, E-NEW-ON-NONCONSTRUCT, one `protected` variant) + a **reverse ratchet** (every explained code has ≥1 emission site). (B1-5) | ☐ |
| UA-0.6 | P2 | **Static-FIELD-via-instance diagnostic**: `a.s` on a static field falls through to a generic code-less message (`src/checker/calls.rs:1709`) while the method sibling got `E-STATIC-VIA-INSTANCE` in W0-3 — mirror the shipped pattern + corpus case. (B1-6) | ☐ |
| UA-0.7 | P2 | **17 emitted E-codes with zero test coverage** — one triggering test each (hooks ×4, E-UFCS-AMBIGUOUS, E-VARIANT-QUALIFIER, E-PARENT-AMBIGUOUS, E-DECIMAL-LITERAL, E-OVERLOAD-FN-VALUE, E-NEW-ON-NONCONSTRUCT, …; table in raw/A3 F6). (B1-7) | ☐ |
| UA-0.8 | P2 | Format `selftest/{arithmetic,faults}.phg` (missed by the Phase-1 reformat) AND strengthen the fmt corpus test to assert `fmt(src) == src` (currently idempotency-only, so tracked files can drift). (B1-8) | ☐ |
| UA-0.9 | P2 | Attach `[E-…]` codes to the most common diagnostics (arg-type, arity, expected/found — `check --json` emits `"code":null` for them) + fix the unknown-MEMBER misreport (`String.lenght` → "unknown identifier 'String'"). (B1-9) | ☐ |
| UA-0.10 | P2 | `phg benchmark --vs-php` hardening: run php with `-n` (or detect+warn Xdebug/DEBUG builds) — the PHP leg currently aborts silently past 512-deep recursion and comparisons fold in a debug interpreter. (B1-10) | ☐ |
| UA-0.11 | P2 | CI fixes: cargo-zigbuild via `taiki-e/install-action`/binstall (built from source every run today); gate job → nextest; `oracle-nightly` cron-only (currently every push, ~25% of runner minutes); rust-cache in playground.yml. (B1-11) | ☐ |
| UA-0.12 | P2 | Install `wasm-pack` locally (playground Rust-side changes are untestable end-to-end today). (B1-12) | ☐ |
| UA-0.13 | P2 | **Promote the A5 native-vs-PHP fuzz probes into the standing differential gate** (non-ASCII whitespace, multibyte, empty separators) — the structural mitigation for the byte-identity-leak class; every UA-1 fix lands its case here same-commit. (B1-13) | ☐ |
| UA-0.14 | P2 | **Disclosures to ADD** (known-but-undisclosed): no-sandbox/full-user-authority trust model; `Math.pow(0.0, neg)` PHP-deprecation note; `List.append` O(n²) + the `List.fill`+index-set fast path (user-facing, not just a Rust doc comment); `String.length` byte semantics until W4-4; widen W5-13 scope (span reset also mis-anchors checker diagnostics in interpolation); `PHORJ_SKIP_PHP`+`PHORJ_REQUIRE_PHP` precedence. (B1-14) | ☐ |
| UA-0.15 | P3 | `php_escape` single-vs-double-quote context mismatch (latent, unexploitable today): rename → `php_escape_dq`, add `php_escape_sq`, switch the two call sites (`src/transpile/program.rs:1380,1392`; `transpile/mod.rs:835-839`). (B1-15) | ☐ |
| UA-0.16 | P3 | `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` for `Hash.equals` (already in the dep tree via argon2) + `cargo-audit` in CI for the vetted pins. (B1-16) | ☐ |
| UA-0.17 | P3 | **Ghost/stale diagnostic-code cleanup**: drop never-raised explain entries `E-OVERLOAD-SELECT-CONFLICT` + `E-PKG-TYPE`; fix comment-only ghosts `E-TYPE-IMPORT-BUILTIN/SHADOW` (`loader/mod.rs:617`, `resolve.rs:590`), the `E-STATIC-INIT-CONST` claim (`value.rs:596`), the self-contradicting `casing.rs:398` comment. (B1-17) | ☐ |
| UA-0.18 | P3 | Correct the `Suspend` trait doc comment (`src/green/exec.rs:40` — claims a nonexistent wasm frame-swap implementor; dep-isolation is the true justification). (B1-18) | ☐ |
| UA-0.19 | P3 | Delete stray `target/` scratch dirs (`s2c_php_check/`, `s2d_php_check/`, empty `tmp/`) — they false-positive `phg format --check .`. (B1-19) | ☐ |

### 2.2 UA-1..UA-L · Bucket 2 — the seventeen RULED decisions as work items

**Small/Medium code fixes (rulings final — implement exactly as ruled):**

| # | Ruling (2026-07-03, developer) | Scope notes |
|---|---|---|
| UA-1.1 | **`String.trim/trimStart/trimEnd` → Rust's Unicode-aware trim stays canonical; the PHP leg emits a matching Unicode-whitespace helper** (Option 2 — REVERSED the synthesis rec after evidence that codepoint/Unicode-by-default is the project's already-decided `String` direction, byte-exact lives on `Bytes`; W4-4 draft). (B2-1a, P0) | `src/native/text.rs:25,405,414,459`; transpile helper; adversarial differential case (`"\u{00A0}x"`) same-commit |
| UA-1.2 | **`String.reverse` → char-wise on both legs; PHP gets an mb-safe helper** (Option 1 — byte-mangling multibyte is the surprise Phorj removes). (B2-1b, P0) | `text.rs:40,477`; differential case with multibyte input |
| UA-1.3 | **`Hash.pbkdf2` → widen the internal iteration counter to u64; NO u32::MAX guard/fault** (Option 2 — REVERSED: u32::MAX is an implementation accident, not a domain limit; 2^32 iterations ≈ minutes, not years; `pbkdf2_sha256` is hand-rolled at `src/native/hash.rs:444`, so widening is free and fixes the root cause — silent truncation of a security parameter). (B2-1d, P0 + security) | `hash.rs:516-518`; KAT + differential case |
| UA-1.4 | **`Hash.hmac` → returns `bytes`** (BREAKING, deliberate: hex is a transport concern, not a MAC's output type; makes hmac/hkdf/pbkdf2 uniform; blast radius verified tiny — `examples/guide/crypto-mac.phg:13` + 1 README line; pre-1.0). (B2-5) | Update example + README; differential |
| UA-1.5 | **`->` retirement sequence: docs/help pass FIRST, then flip the parser-reject, then fix gate-surfaced sites INDIVIDUALLY** (Option 1). The 6 accept-sites: `src/parser/types.rs:109`, `items.rs:240/296/370/735`, `exprs.rs:546` (+ lexer `mod.rs:1125`). ~1700 embedded arrows in `src/` preludes + `tests/*.rs` strings; **NO bulk sed** — the 2026-07-03 attempt proved regex cannot distinguish return-`-> T` from function-type `-> T` (recovery lessons preserved in git history at `0691228`, wave0-remainder "ATTEMPT + RECOVERY"). ~200-site ambiguous tail is gate-guided, `=>` for fn types / `:` for returns. Fresh session recommended. (B2-3, P1; = cleanup Phase 1 remainder) | Docs half largely covered by the Stage-D pass + UA-0.3; then the flip |
| UA-1.6 | **Empty-`[]` type inference extends from List to Map positions** — `Map<string,int> e = [];` must check. **PLUS (same work, ruled follow-up): `[...]` becomes context-typed for `Set` too** — Set currently has ZERO literal syntax (`Set<int> s = [1,2,3];` type-errors; `{1,2,3}` doesn't parse); same expected-type mechanism, no new syntax token. (B2-4 + Set expansion) | Checker expected-type rule; differential cases for all three collection literals. **⚠ SCOPE FINDING (2026-07-04): deeper than a checker-type tweak. `List<T> x=[]` works because the runtime value of `[]` is naturally an empty `Value::List` (stmt.rs:104-119 just TYPES it, no backend change). But empty-`[]`→Map and `[1,2,3]`→Set need the BACKEND to build a Map/Set (not the default List), so they require a checker-fact-driven DESUGAR (empty-`[]`→`Expr::Map([])`; `[elems]`→`Set.of([...])` — Invariant-5 compile-time sugar) fed by expected-type→list-literal threading. That threading is EXACTLY W3-5's blocker option (A) — building it once unblocks BOTH UA-1.6 and W3-5. Do them together; not a tail-of-session change.** |
| UA-1.7 | **`Math.clamp(min > max)` → faults** (matches the module's precondition convention and Rust's own `clamp`). (B2-6) | One guard + fault string + differential |
| UA-1.8 | **Fault-message canonicalization on `"Module.function: message"`** — sweep the ~40 stale strings (pre-rename `Text.`/`Convert.`/`Validate.` prefixes, never-existed `Bytes.from_string`, 4 competing shapes). Parity-affecting (Invariant 4): full differential gate. (B2-9) | One sweep; before more natives land |
| UA-1.9 | **Import-redesign guide example: yes** — one small guide example + README row for the S0–S2 member-import/qualified discipline. (B2-12) | Cheap; closes the Invariant-9 gap |
| UA-1.10 | **`playground/src/lib.rs`: try `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` empirically**; if wasm-bindgen glue genuinely needs unsafe, record the exemption in INVARIANTS instead. (B2-13) | Try-first, fall back to recorded exemption |

**Large-scope tracked waves (grew out of the audit gate — first-class items, each needs a
design/spec pass in UNIFIED-SPEC before implementation, NOT just a code diff):**

#### UA-L1 · Native-error checked-exceptions: taxonomy spec + 4-native pilot — L · DESIGN-NEEDED
- **RULED (B2-1c expansion):** today ALL ~236 natives' argument/domain errors are a deliberate
  UNCATCHABLE fault tier, structurally disconnected from the (good, shipped) `throws`/`try`/`catch`
  checked-exception system (verified: `try{ String.count("abc","") }catch(Error e)` never fires;
  `src/vm/exec.rs:399-408` bare `?` on `Op::CallNative`). The developer ruled: **design the
  taxonomy + class-hierarchy spec now** (which failures are recoverable domain errors vs programmer
  bugs; Core.ValueError/RangeError-style family vs per-module types), **pilot checked-throw
  semantics on exactly the four UA-1 natives (trim/reverse/split/pbkdf2) as the first real
  example, ship together, then roll the remaining ~232 natives out in tracked follow-up waves** —
  NOT a flag-day rewrite. Breaking-change note: natives declaring `throws` makes untried call
  sites stop compiling — the rollout waves carry corpus migration.
- **Within the pilot:** `String.split/splitOnce("")` empty-separator divergence (Rust total,
  PHP fatal — the original B2-1c bug) is resolved BY the pilot's checked-throw semantics on both
  legs, not by a standalone fault.
- **ACCEPTANCE:** spec section ratified; 4 pilot natives throw checked exceptions byte-identically
  (incl. the PHP leg); differential + adversarial cases; rollout waves enumerated in this plan.

#### UA-L2 · Injected-prelude → module-loader unification — L · DESIGN-NEEDED · **BEFORE W3-1/W3-2**
- **RULED (B2-2):** unify stdlib type resolution with the loader (virtual Core modules) NOW,
  before the DB/HTTP waves multiply the registry. The ~5 special-case rules
  (E-INJECTED-TYPE-BARE, leaf qualification, prelude exemption, collapse pass, hand-synced
  registry in `checker::enforce_injected::module_of`) exist only because `inject_*_prelude` ×6
  bypasses the loader. The S1/S2 user-facing surface (member-imports, qualified forms) is
  PRESERVED — one resolution path underneath.
- **ACCEPTANCE:** injected-type behavior byte-identical pre/post (the S2 test set is the gate);
  the collapse/enforce special-case passes deleted or reduced to loader rules; W3-1/W3-2 blocked
  on this landing.

#### UA-L3 · ReDoS transpile-time static complexity analyzer — L · DESIGN-NEEDED
- **RULED (B2-7):** FULL mitigation, not disclosure-only (developer explicitly chose the harder
  option). Problem: Rust's `regex` crate is linear-time (no backtracking, no backrefs/lookaround);
  PHP's PCRE backtracks — `(a+)+$` compiles fine under BOTH, runs instantly natively, and
  catastrophically backtracks under PCRE on adversarial input. "Compiles under the regex crate"
  is NOT a sufficient check. Needs a real static complexity analyzer at transpile time
  (safe-regex-style nested/overlapping-quantifier detection), with the false-positive
  (blocking legit patterns) and false-negative risks designed for explicitly — **do not scope
  this down to a KNOWN_ISSUES paragraph.**
- **ACCEPTANCE:** design section in UNIFIED-SPEC (detection heuristic, error/warn tier, escape
  hatch); transpile rejects the known-catastrophic corpus; FP corpus documented; disclosure
  paragraph ships with it (the honest interim is disclosure — but the tracked item is the analyzer).

#### UA-L4 · VM string performance: `Rc<str>` Value refactor — L
- **RULED (B2-10):** the full architectural fix — `Value::Str` becomes Rc-shared (the only non-Rc
  compound variant today; `Op::GetLocal` deep-clones every read, `src/value.rs:124`,
  `src/vm/exec.rs:149-153`) + COW `make_mut` path for mutating natives. Measured: VM is 1.53×
  SLOWER than the interpreter on string concat — inverts the documented contract.
- **ACCEPTANCE:** full differential gate + before/after `phg benchmark` per G-2 (parity-affecting
  surface); the inversion workload flips.

#### UA-L5 · THE rename wave — one batch, everything — M/L
- **RULED (B2-8):** fold EVERYTHING into ONE rename wave (not staged): the approved trio
  (`Bytes.find→indexOf`, `Map.has→containsKey`, slice-convention unification to
  length+negatives) PLUS all audit-surfaced candidates: `length` vs `size` (List/String/Bytes vs
  Map/Set), `count`'s two meanings (List predicate vs String needle), `Core.Conversion`'s three
  naming families + `Conversion.round` duplicating `Math.round`, `intBetween`/`secureInt` ranged-
  pair naming, `nowMilliseconds`/`monotonicNanos` unit suffixes. Crypto 3-module split stays
  (ruled KEEP — mirrors PHP's own layering) + one cross-referencing docs paragraph.
  (= cleanup Phase 2, widened.)
- **ACCEPTANCE:** naming section of UNIFIED-SPEC updated first; renames + all .phg/test/doc
  usages one wave; zero grep hits for retired names; byte-identity gate.

#### UA-L6 · Stdlib additive wave — one batch, everything — M
- **RULED (B2-11):** approved items (`String.startsWith/endsWithIgnoreCase`, `replaceFirst`,
  `Set.isSuperset/symmetricDifference/isDisjoint/map/filter`, `Math` Float variants) + new
  candidates ship together: `Bytes.isEmpty`, `Map.entries` + `Map.of`/`fromList`,
  document-level `Csv.parse` (multi-row), `Math.ceil/floor→float` vs `round→int` return-type
  note. (= cleanup Phase 3, widened.) Examples + tests per G-5.

### 2.3 UA-D · Bucket 3 — doc-only corrections (EXECUTING in this Stage-D pass)

Fourteen findings, five of them P0 false-claim families — all being corrected in the 2026-07-03
consolidation (this file + UNIFIED-SPEC + the sibling corrections to KNOWN_ISSUES/FEATURES/
ARCHITECTURE/STABILITY/GA-CHECKLIST/ROADMAP/VISION/README/CONTRIBUTING). Checklist for
verification, then this section collapses to "done + never reintroduce" (G-7):

- ☐ B3-1 "zero external deps" FALSE everywhere (4 default deps: argon2, regex, ctrlc, corosensei;
  rusqlite+rustls now approved as feature-gated domains) — incl. `Cargo.toml:83-85` comment.
- ☐ B3-2 `import type` taught as current syntax (it hard-fails to parse since S0) — docs, .phg
  comments, ~14 src doc-comments.
- ☐ B3-3 dead CLI verbs (`fmt`/`lex`/`disasm`/`bench`) taught as real, declared *stable*; the
  real verbs are `format`/`tokenize`/`disassemble`/`benchmark`.
- ☐ B3-4 `E-TRANSPILE-CONCURRENCY` does not exist — the code is `E-CONCURRENCY-NO-PHP`
  (fixed in THIS file at G-1.1); `E-RETIRED-SYNTAX` labeled *planned*.
- ☐ B3-5 FEATURES 🔲/🚧 on SHIPPED features (traits-construct, concurrency, lift, LSP, formatter,
  Set-algebra); GA-CHECKLIST "Missing: an LSP" false → its ≈57% retired.
- ☐ B3-6 the 16 doc-vs-doc contradiction pairs (table in raw/A4 §C) — resolved once at merge.
- ☑ B3-7 percentage staleness — re-scored in §11.2 (this file).
- ☐ B3-8 undocumented shipped features (W3-4 crypto FEATURES row; S1/S2 import discipline
  user-facing doc; decimal row; ctrlc/corosensei named; playground-member deps in the dep policy).
- ☐ B3-9 the 5 `examples/project/` dirs indexed nowhere + `web/json-api.phg` index row.
- ☑ B3-10 stale counts in plans (KNOWN_ISSUES 1133, differential.rs 3308, explain ≈200 codes,
  28 stdlib modules / 236 natives; "S1 uncommitted" claim — S1 shipped `cd29f3c`) — corrected here.
- ☐ B3-11 KNOWN_ISSUES stale content (`\Main\Obj`, the contradicted "not yet implemented" list,
  `->` prose ×10) — sibling pass + UA-1.5 doc half.
- ☐ B3-12 archive the superseded research corpus (~1.07 MB raw dirs) once Stage E closes;
  `roadmap-completeness/raw/` is historical-only (its claims are refuted at HEAD).
- ☐ B3-13 ARCHITECTURE.md:88 stale embedded verification command; statics research-spec header.
- ☐ B3-14 undocumented flags into help (`--dump-on-fault`, `benchmark --json`,
  `build --dev`/`--sign`); `phg --help` arrow prose (folds into UA-1.5).

### 2.4 UA-W · Bucket 4 — watch / defer (known, deliberately not active)

Do NOT work these without a trigger; do NOT drop them either.

| # | Watch item | Trigger / note |
|---|---|---|
| B4-1 | **Four-backend maintenance tax** (~28% of src + the heaviest harness) — root cause of the UA-1 drift class; verdict: right call (byte-identity IS the product). | Re-weigh the VM's perf justification at GA; the cheap mitigation is UA-0.13, not fewer backends |
| B4-2 | DAP transport write errors silently swallowed + non-loud malformed Content-Length in both framers | Scheduled in W0-10 (a/b) — do there |
| B4-3 | Zero direct tests for `src/dispatch.rs` + `src/json.rs` | Rides W0-10's A-TEST-1 |
| B4-4 | File-size rule unenforced (12 files > 1000 lines, no size-gate.sh) | W1-6 builds the gate |
| B4-5 | **W2-7 (PSR-4 import roots) was designed BEFORE the unified-import model** — re-base/re-adjudicate before build or it becomes import redesign #5 | Hard gate on W2-7 |
| B4-6 | `src/checker/` at ~21K lines is the gravitational center; three near-identical type-walkers | Consolidate when the NEXT type-walking pass is added, not before |
| B4-7 | VM per-dispatch String clones (CallMethod ×2, MakeEnum, MatchTag, MakeInstance; GetField's inline-cache technique applies) | Needs measured before/after; UA-L4 first |
| B4-8 | Monolithic 84 kLoC crate → 50.3 s release rebuilds; incremental dev builds healthy (4.5–7.6 s) | Crate split only if release-rebuild pain becomes real |
| B4-9 | `List.append` refcount-1 fast path (signature or owned-arg path) | Guidance half is UA-0.14 |
| B4-10 | DX wishlist: debugger REPL eval, did-you-mean on dead verbs/unknown flags, `(os error 2)` leak, `phg format` exclude mechanism, `phg fmt` alias | Batch when touching the CLI surface |
| B4-11 | Dev-loop nice-to-haves: green-tree stamp, `debug = "line-tables-only"` (target/ is 22 GB), periodic target sweep | Opportunistic |
| B4-12 | Hand-rolled SHA-256 now underpins keyed crypto — tension with the charter's never-roll-your-own clause; mitigated by RFC KATs + oracle byte-identity | Revisit if RustCrypto enters the tree (e.g. with rustls) |
| B4-13 | Unbounded self-DoS allocations (secureBytes(exabytes), regex cache no eviction) — no resource-quota model by design | Listed for completeness |
| B4-14 | Two production `expect` on scheduler invariants (`interpreter/coop.rs:103`, `green/exec.rs:131`) — internal, not user-reachable | None |
| B4-15 | `examples.js` staleness CI check (`gen_examples.py && git diff --exit-code`) — artifact currently NOT stale | Add when touching playground CI |

### 2.5 Positive attestations (do not re-litigate)

`src/` structurally clean (0 stubs/TODOs/dead-code allows; Op coupling 73/73/73 wildcard-free;
`forbid(unsafe_code)` both crate roots; kernels single-sourced; deps exactly per policy; all prior
src P0/P1s verified FIXED). All 9 golden diagnostics byte-identical; `phg explain` covers 100% of
emitted codes; zero Rust panics across every error probe. Security posture strong: 0 High findings,
13 positive attestations (Argon2id/OWASP defaults, fail-loud CSPRNG, no shell anywhere, hardened
vendor, injection-safe PHP emission, bounded serve). No premature abstraction (4 traits / 75K LOC).
Corpus 100% clean of syntactic `->` and `import type`; formatter idempotent; single-test loop 0.26 s.

### 2.6 Cleanup-program phase reconciliation (the old P1–P6 map onto this programme)

| Old phase (wave0-remainder) | Now lives at |
|---|---|
| P1 remainder (`->` parser reject) | UA-1.5 (with the attempt+recovery lessons carried) |
| P2 renames | UA-L5 (widened to the full batch, ruled) |
| P3 additive natives | UA-L6 (widened, ruled) |
| P4+P5 docs consolidation | §2.3 Bucket 3 + this file + UNIFIED-SPEC (executing) |
| P6 editor/LSP refresh | W6-8, gated on the corpus being clean (post UA-1.5/UA-L5) |
| Final convergence verification | Stage E: full gate re-verify + archive the audit raw dirs (B3-12) |

### 2.7 AUTONOMOUS OVERNIGHT MARATHON — execution queue (set 2026-07-04)

> **Goal (developer, 2026-07-04):** a large autonomous run that ships **features + runnable examples +
> up-to-date VSCode & PhpStorm editor support**, so the developer can build & real-test a real Phorj
> project the next morning. Runs autonomously (autonomous-3c); **commit each green self-contained
> step** (phorj rule — `feat:`/`fix:`/`docs:`, no `Co-Authored-By`); **never `git push`**. This is an
> ORDERING over the already-ruled work below — nothing here is a new decision (except the two clearly
> marked NEW deliverables), and nothing overrides §15 (surface a genuine fork, don't guess).

**Definition of done per step (all must hold before moving on):**
1. Full gate GREEN on the real oracle: `source scripts/toolchain.env && PHORJ_REQUIRE_PHP=1 cargo test
   --workspace` + clippy + fmt + `cargo build --release` (php-8.5.8; a missing php FAILS, never skips).
2. Invariant 9 — every shipped feature lands a runnable `examples/**/*.phg` (auto-gated by the
   differential glob) + an `examples/README.md` row, same commit.
3. Byte-identity holds (`run ≡ runvm ≡ transpiled PHP`) unless the item is a ruled quarantine
   (concurrency, impure natives, the UA-L1 checked-exception pilot cases).
4. Report `target/release/phg` path after each shipped feature (standing rule).

**Ordered queue** (stop-and-surface via §15 on any genuine language fork — do NOT self-rule):

- **M0 — hygiene/unblockers first (fast, no design risk):**
  - Repoint the 11 live spec pointers → `UNIFIED-SPEC.md` sections and **archive all 18
    `docs/specs/2026-*.md`** (developer ruled "review-then-archive"; faithfulness already verified —
    closeout TASK-3 PASS). Repoint map: closeout TASK-4 list (README/FEATURES/VISION/STABILITY/
    THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES/docs/examples are live pointers; CHANGELOG + `src/*.rs` provenance comments
    may stay as historical). `git mv` originals into `docs/specs/archive/`.
  - **NEW — fix `playground/web/gen_examples.py` non-determinism** (Rule 10 violation): it emits the
    example list in filesystem/dict order → the committed `examples.js` reorders on every regen
    (proven pure-reorder, 0 content delta). Sort deterministically, regenerate, commit once. (Bucket-1.)
  - The rest of **UA-0 / Bucket 1** (§2.1): mold linker wiring, the broken `phg run --help` examples
    (also drops their `->`), missing diagnostic corpus cases, the KNOWN_ISSUES disclosures, gate-test
    sharding, stray `target/` scratch dirs.
- **M1 — language self-consistency (unblocks everything a real project touches):** UA-1.1..1.4 (the 4
  byte-identity fixes incl. `Hash.hmac`→bytes), UA-1.6 (Set/Map empty-literal inference), UA-1.7
  (`Math.clamp` fault), UA-1.8 (fault-message canonicalization). Then **UA-1.5 (`->` retirement:
  docs/help first — mostly done — then parser-reject, then individual gate-guided fixes; NO bulk sed).**
- **M2 — architecture-before-waves:** UA-L2 (injected-prelude → loader unification, MUST precede
  W3-1/W3-2) · UA-L4 (`Rc<str>` VM string fix, benchmark before/after per Invariant 11).
- **M3 — the web-app spine (the heart of "real project"):** §12 ROI order — W3-5 `String.format`
  (SURFACE the `{}`-grammar blocker via §15 FIRST, then build) → W3-1 SQL DBAL (SQLite P1) → W3-2
  HTTP client → W3-3/6/8 finish the serve/router spine. Each ships examples.
- **M4 — stdlib breadth for real apps:** UA-L5 (the one naming-rename wave) · UA-L6 (additive
  batch) · UA-L1 (native-error checked-exception taxonomy spec + 4-native pilot) · UA-L3 (ReDoS
  transpile-time analyzer — needs its design pass).
- **M5 — NEW: editor support so the project is actually writable/testable in an IDE:**
  - **VSCode** (`editors/vscode/`): update `syntaxes/phorj.tmLanguage.json` to the current surface
    (`=>`/`:` not `->`, current keywords, unified `import`, `#[Http.Route]` attrs, decimal/bytes
    literals); confirm `extension.js` launches `phg lsp` as the LSP client (wire it if not); fix the
    README's dead verbs (`phg fmt`→`format`); bump version + rebuild the `.vsix`.
  - **PhpStorm** (`editors/phpstorm/`): **FINDING (2026-07-04) — the "README-ONLY, no working path"
    premise was stale.** `editors/phpstorm/README.md` already documents a complete, functional
    NO-BUILD path that delivers the full feature set today: JetBrains' built-in **TextMate Bundle**
    import (pointed at `editors/vscode/`, reusing the shared grammar) for highlighting + the
    **LSP4IJ** marketplace plugin running `phg lsp` for diagnostics/hover/completion/rename/format.
    Both editor READMEs already track the *natively-compiled marketplace plugin* as a follow-up.
    Refreshed the docs (dead `phg fmt`→`phg format` verb) in this pass. **PENDING scope decision
    (recorded per §15 "surface, don't self-rule" + "surface scope if it balloons"):** should the run
    build a native Gradle/IntelliJ-Platform plugin? Analysis for the developer: (a) the no-build
    path already delivers full functionality; (b) a native plugin is a large lift (Gradle +
    IntelliJ-Platform SDK + Kotlin/plugin.xml) and **cannot be verified here** (needs a running
    PhpStorm), so it would ship unproven — against the evidence-before-completion discipline;
    (c) recommendation → **keep the no-build path as the supported story; defer the native plugin**
    unless the developer wants to invest a large, here-untestable build. Not autonomously ruled.
  - Refresh `examples/guide/` walkthroughs referenced by both extensions; re-gen the playground.
- **M6 — Core.Dotenv (UA-L7, developer-requested full Symfony cascade):** write the design spec first
  (taxonomy · the `test`-env "`.env.local` skipped" footgun decision · Secret-type integration · the
  emitted PHP cascade helper · quarantine), then implement + example. Layers on existing
  `Core.Environment`. (Sequence after M3's web spine, since dotenv serves web apps.)
- **Close — convergence verification:** full gate re-verify; recompute the §11 percentage (824-row
  re-score) + update the §0 cursor; `/handoff`.

**Autonomous guardrails:** obey §15 (ADJUDICATION) — record genuine user-visible forks as PENDING and
keep going on the rest; never silently downgrade byte-identity (§14 LADDER); the 5-round advisor cap
still escalates via `ask-human` even autonomously. Update the §0 cursor block at each milestone close.

## 3. WAVE 0 — REPAIRS & HYGIENE (status ledger)

*All rulings in Appendix B; zero language-surface change. Detail recipes: git history `0691228`.*

| Item | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| W0-1 | Restore pre-commit gate (hooksPath) | ✅ `c66bde5` |
| W0-2 | Static-field visibility spine repair | ✅ (wave-0 slate `f28d950..c0f8969`) |
| W0-3 | Static-method-via-instance error | ✅ (slate; the FIELD mirror is UA-0.6) |
| W0-4 | Loader package gates + E-ALIAS-CYCLE | ✅ (slate, both halves) |
| W0-5 | VM interpolation fault-line disclosure | ✅ (slate; fix = W5-13; scope widened per UA-0.14) |
| W0-6 | Front door: doc snippets + CLI renames + CI doc-check | ✅ halves 1/2 (slate); **remainder = W0-6b**: verb-rename sweep across the 12 enumerated files + the CI ```phorj-fence `phg check` job (fold with §2.3 B3-3) |
| W0-7 | Doc-reconciliation + CLAUDE.md rules-only rewrite | ✅ `c66bde5` + consolidation pass |
| W0-8 | Plan-file deletions + de-dangle | ✅ (48 + second batch) |
| W0-9 | Housekeeping: branches, dist/, KNOWN_ISSUES prune, examples index restructure | ☐ — KNOWN_ISSUES prune + examples restructure fold into §2.3 (B3-9/B3-11) + the sibling pass; branches/dist remain |
| W0-10 | P2 hardening batch (DAP dead-flag, framing errors, CI pins, `usize::try_from`, package-lock, W-SECRET note, json.rs+dispatch.rs unit tests) | ☐ — CI-pin half needs verified external data (never guess a pin/SHA) |
| W0-11 | realworld Core.File example | ☐ |
| W0-12 | PUSH + external renames (repo rename, dir mv) | ☐ developer-gated — NEVER autonomous |

## 4. WAVE 1 — DECOMPOSITION

*The B-modularity spec executed verbatim: moves-only, zero behavior change, one cluster per commit,
full differential each. Do-not-split list honored. Detail: raw/B-modularity.md + git history.*

- **W1-1** `tests/differential.rs` split (3308 lines → directory-form, test-count parity) — step 0.
- **W1-2** Mechanical off-spine splits (chunk, cli/mod+preludes, serve, lift/parser, lift/lifter, fmt/printer).
- **W1-3** Front-end splits (lexer, parser/items, checker/program+totality+expr+casts+calls+collect).
- **W1-4** Spine splits (value/, interpreter, compiler ×2 — scratch-slot discipline —, transpile/program) + the Op-exhaustiveness smoke test.
- **W1-5** Decompose the three ~500-line functions (`main.rs::main`, `check_interface_graph`, `compile_program_with`) + cognitive-complexity ratchet.
- **W1-6** `scripts/size-gate.sh` in CI + G-6 write-back (calibrated post-split).
- **W1-7** Clarity workstream: ARCHITECTURE narrated rewrite, `//!` module docs, blanket `clippy::pedantic` fix-all (DEC-176).

---

## 5. WAVE 2 — RATIFIED LANGUAGE CHANGES + ENFORCEMENT COMPLETION

*The breaking/codemod wave. W2-1 lands FIRST (converts later codemods into compiler-driven
commands). All rulings Appendix B; item recipes in git history `0691228`.*

- **W2-1** `phg fix` — machine-applicable diagnostics (structured `(span, replacement)` edits; LSP code-actions ride it). The delivery vehicle for everything below.
- **W2-2** E-MATCH-BARE-TYPE hard error (+ 3-way did-you-mean, repo codemod).
- **W2-3** foreach REPLACES for-in (REPLACE, not add — the C-2 drift lesson) + binding forms; full corpus codemod.
- **W2-4** `->` return-syntax retirement — **superseded by UA-1.5's ruled sequence** (docs first → parser-reject → individual fixes); W-SEQUENCE-MUTATION verify rides along.
- **W2-5** E-INTERSECT-SIG relaxed via the shipped overload-resolution rules.
- **W2-6** DEC-047 no-wind closure: fault intrinsics behind `import Core;` (E-UNIMPORTED), deep imports, aliasing, de-reservations. Spec: UNIFIED-SPEC (no-wind section).
- **W2-7** Import-roots PSR-4 `[packages]` map — **⚠ B4-5 gate: re-base on the unified-import model (S0–S2 + UA-L2) and re-adjudicate BEFORE build.**
- **W2-8** Enforcement adoptions (E-IMPORT-UNKNOWN, E-capture-write + `Core.Ref<T>`, W-family unused/never-thrown lints, NaN→fault unification, the batch-2 ten + batch-3 twenty-six — all adopted, Appendix B).
- **W2-9** Naming-overhaul remainder — **fold into UA-L5** (one rename wave; the naming section of UNIFIED-SPEC is the SSOT).
- **W2-10** Narrow soundness-hole batch (static-init protected ctor, interface throws discharge, `x.m()?`, MI lowering corners…).
- **W2-11** Static-call ergonomics + `this.f[i] = e` field-base index-assign (unblocks W6-4 benchmark ports).
- **W2-12** Erased-generic result as VM operand (close the run↔runvm CTy gap; option ii — kernel-backed dynamic fallback — is the spine-safe default).
- **W2-13** Enforcement audit → should-error conformance suite + the explain-coverage ratchet (UA-0.5/0.7 seed it).
- **W2-14** `new` on enum variants — ✅ ruled KEEP (closed).

## 6. WAVE 3 — WEB-APP ENABLEMENT SPINE

*The critical path: what blocks real applications. Stdlib items follow the M4 charter
(UNIFIED-SPEC, stdlib-charter section). Tier-B (impure) modules quarantined per `pure:false`.*

### Dependency-policy amendment (RULED 2026-07-03, developer)
`rusqlite` (SQLite) + `rustls` (TLS) admitted as new vetted domains — native-only, feature-gated
(`db`/`tls`, off in WASM), spine-quarantined (corosensei/ctrlc shape), `forbid(unsafe_code)`
intact in phorj's own code. Pure zero-dep P0s ship FIRST (`Core.Sql`, `Core.Url`). Recorded in
UNIFIED-SPEC (dependency-policy section). **Gate: UA-L2 (prelude/loader unification) lands before
W3-1/W3-2 add stdlib types.**

- **W3-1 · SQL DBAL** (XL, design draft at `docs/research/wave3-4-drafts/`) — **scope RULED:** a
  multi-driver data-access layer (PDO/Doctrine-DBAL analog): SQLite (P1, rusqlite, embedded) +
  Postgres (`postgres` sync) + MySQL/MariaDB (`mysql` sync; one driver = both). ALL sync — async
  runtimes stay policy-rejected. **Oracle DEFERRED** (closed Instant Client violates policy
  clause 2). **MongoDB = a SEPARATE future LADDER item** (non-SQL/no-PDO → native-only
  `E-TRANSPILE-MONGO`, no PHP leg; async-driver problem) — its own XL design, NOT part of the DBAL.
  `Core.Sql` builder is Tier-A byte-identity; execution Tier-B fixture-tested. Faithful PDO mapping
  ⇒ does NOT trigger the ladder.
- **W3-2 · HTTP client** (XL, draft exists) — typed client over the shipped Request/Response,
  middleware closures, pooling on green threads, HTTPS via the rustls feature fork. Ships pure
  `Core.Url` (spec-compliant parser + build_query — leapfrogs `parse_url`) FIRST. Layered design
  ruled (Appendix B): HttpClient engine + `Http.get/post` sugar.
- **W3-3 · Sessions/cookies/auth** (L) — value-level (no ambient `$_SESSION`), signed/encrypted
  payloads over W3-4 HMAC, CSRF helpers. DEPS: W3-4 ✅, W3-6.
- **W3-4 · CSPRNG + HMAC/KDF** — ✅ **SHIPPED `f4c4c1d`**: `Core.Hash.hmac/equals/hkdf/pbkdf2`
  (RFC KATs, byte-identical) + `Core.Random.secureBytes/secureInt` (quarantined). Follow-ups now
  tracked: UA-1.3 (pbkdf2 u64), UA-1.4 (hmac→bytes), UA-0.16 (ConstantTimeEq).
- **W3-5 · `String.format` (sprintf family)** — design RULED (developer, 2026-07-03): lives on
  `Core.String` (NOT a new `Fmt` module), Java-familiar `format(spec, args) -> string`, **`{}`-style
  spec grammar shared with W5-1** interpolation specifiers (`%`-style rejected). **✅ BLOCKER RESOLVED
  2026-07-04 (DEC-178):** option (A) chosen — expected-type threading into list-literal call args is
  built as part of the **Type-System programme (Wave A / §2.7)**; `String.format` args use a CLOSED
  scalar form (not open `Any`). W3-5 now rides Wave A (→ Wave C) and needs no further adjudication.
- **W3-6 · Filesystem breadth + serve static-handle bridge** (L) — `Core.Directory`
  (mkdir/listDir/glob/…), fs-OOP question resolved (statics until streams demand handles); serve
  class-static `handle` entry. FS design ruled (Appendix B): Path value type, stateless IO,
  `throws FileError` default + `readOrNull()` explicit.
- **W3-7 · Structured logging** (M) — `Core.Log`, record construction pure, emission Tier-B;
  serve request logging.
- **W3-8 · Json encode + safe-parse hardening + rich responses** (M). NDJSON
  (`Json.parseLines/stringifyLines`) ✅ shipped `4dbd360`; INI (`Core.Ini.parse`) ✅ shipped
  `4f4f271` (hand-rolled PHP-charset trim — note UA-1.1 keeps `String.trim` Unicode; Ini's own
  parser keeps its PHP-exact set).
- **W3-9 · Method references as values** (M) — `obj.method` → typed closure; fixes the misleading
  "no field m" diagnostic.

---

## 7. WAVE 4 — MIGRATION-BRIDGE COMPLETION

- **W4-1 · Named args + variadics + spread** (L, DESIGN) — param-renaming policy decided up front
  (DEF-034); unblocks W3-5 variadic overload + the lifter on 8.0+ code.
- **W4-2 · Generators/`yield` + iterator protocol** (XL, DESIGN) — corosensei substrate; design
  must prove byte-identity vs PHP generators or explicitly extend G-1.1 (default: prove it).
- **W4-3 · Printable/`__toString` + `__invoke`** (M) — explicit checked contract; W5-2 derive(Show)
  auto-implements.
- **W4-4 · Unicode-correct strings** (XL, DESIGN, draft exists) — RULED adopt (codepoints default;
  bytes stay explicit on `Bytes`). **Known landmine from the draft: case-folding diverges from the
  `php -n` tier-1 oracle** (`strtoupper("straße")` keeps ß vs Rust STRASSE) → LADDER-quarantine
  candidate, surface at design time; ~12/35 Core.String natives change; `Value::Str` untouched
  (UA-L4 is orthogonal). UA-1.1's Unicode-trim ruling is the first plank of this direction.
- **W4-5 · Date/time breadth** (L) — IANA tz, formatting, DatePeriod, explicit-format parsing.
- **W4-6 · Stdlib blitz** (L) — list/math long tail per charter; `zip` after tuples (W5-10).
- **W4-7 · Lift Tier-2/3 depth + playground PHP input** (L) — after W4-1/W4-2/W3-5.
- **W4-8 · General inert attributes** (M) — inert-only ruled; derive (W5-2) is the behavioral surface.
- **W4-9 · Dynamic `Json`/`Any` boundary completion** (M).
- **W4-10 · XML/DOM/XPath** (L, DESIGN-NEEDED) — **PENDING adjudication artifact recorded**
  (2026-07-03): user-visible surface, developer's call; proposal + failing program + option
  previews to be presented, not built autonomously. Phased, PHP-DOM-backed per the format recipe.
- **W4-11 · Subprocess execution** (M, charter admission) — arg-vector only, no shell-string, ever.
- **W4-12 · Compression/archives + regex breadth** (L) — preg_replace_callback rides HigherOrder;
  **regex additions coordinate with UA-L3's analyzer.**
- **W4-13 · BigInt + arbitrary precision + Money** (L, DESIGN).

---

## 8. WAVE 5 — BEYOND-PHP PROGRAMME

*All 13 ADOPT-NOW items ruled (Appendix B). Compressed index — per-item LENS/HOW in git history.*

- **W5-1..W5-12**: interpolation format specifiers (grammar shared with W3-5) · closed derive
  channel (`Equals/Show/Hash/Ord/Default`, wave 2 `Json`) · sealed hierarchies · doc-tests ·
  opaque newtypes · Optional/Result combinators · compile-time-validated literals (regex literals
  coordinate with UA-L3) · let-else · auto-import quickfix/organizer · tuples + multiple return ·
  Printable (=W4-3) · labeled loops. `phg fix` = W2-1.
- **W5-13 · VM debug symbols** (L) — scope IP ranges → named locals → per-line pause → DAP over
  runvm; fixes the interpolation fault-line divergence (flip the W0-5 harness flag on).
- **W5-14 · M-perf lane** (L) — CallMethod inline cache, CallValue captures borrow, static/const
  borrow-keyed lookup; **the Rc-share `Value::Str` item is now UA-L4 (pulled forward, ruled)**;
  IsInstance interning, dispatch, const-fold, peephole, lazy for-range; incremental compilation
  (design). Every item: `phg benchmark` before/after.
- **W5-15 · DX cluster** (L) — `phg repl`, `phg doc` (format co-designed with doc-tests), parser
  multi-error recovery.
- **W5-16 · Concurrency completion** (XL, DESIGN) — structured scopes, deterministic `select`,
  deadlines, Task.all/race (colored async stays REJECTED); **M-Parallel = WORKER ISOLATES ruled**
  (own heap/thread, channel messaging; shared-memory Arc rewrite REJECTED); deep plan first.
- **W5-17 · Ruled checkpoints**: generics explicit type args BOTH sites ✅ ruled · UFCS
  TYPE-SCOPED ✅ ruled (specificity ladder, CI rebind guard) · ternary stays deferred-not-rejected ·
  the bulk-ratified six ✅.
- **ADOPT-LATER charter (27 items)**: each activates on its named trigger (XL-018 defer/XL-019
  using → first handle-based IO = W3-1; XL-021 semver-check → first tagged release; XL-024
  deprecation-codemod → after W2-1; pattern-slice batch XL-029..032; etc.). Conflicts ruled:
  comprehensions REJECT stands; FFI REJECT stands (`.d.phg` is the seam); open macros stay
  rejected (derive is the sanctioned subset).

### §7-CLOSED · `trait` — RULED 2026-07-04 (DEC-177): BLESSED alongside MI
Resolved. The premise was stale: `trait` is NOT unadopted — it is fully wired (lexer keyword,
parser construct with bodies + `use TraitName;`, `run≡runvm`≡transpiled PHP `trait`/`use`, verified
end-to-end). Developer **blessed BOTH `trait` AND multiple-inheritance as first-class** — this
mirrors PHP's own trait/composition duality (familiarity-first). Record in Appendix A as ADOPTED;
FEATURES `trait` entry flips to delivered. No open language question remains here.

---

## 9. WAVE 6 — SHOWCASE, SPEC & GA

- **W6-1** Flagship promotion + ~300-line REST micro-service (post-Wave-3: + DB + sessions).
- **W6-3** Truthful README rewrite — front-page truth is now largely §2.3's Bucket-3 pass; the
  full marketing rewrite (status table, lift promoted, G-1.1 disclosure placement) stays here,
  best after Wave 3.
- **W6-4** Benchmark credibility protocol — retire the dev-PHP number; release PHP 8.5 +
  opcache/JIT columns; methodology doc. DEPS: W2-11; UA-0.10 is the interim guard.
- **W6-5** Normative spec + clause-tagged conformance — chapters grow FROM `docs/specs/
  UNIFIED-SPEC.md` (the consolidation is the seed); spec-coverage matrix as a failing test;
  the G-1.1 disclosure is a normative clause.
- **W6-6** GA hardening batches (LI-G1..G6 — re-verify each first; several likely already fixed).
- **W6-7** Release engineering (reference/tour/migration docs, fuzzing, grammar files, release
  automation, `--sign`, semver-check).
- **W6-8** Editor + docs-site surface — **= cleanup Phase 6**: LSP completion/hover for the new
  natives + injected-type discipline; VSCode tmLanguage/snippets + PhpStorm re-targeted to the
  final `:`/`=>` surface; drop dead verbs. **Gated on the corpus being clean (UA-1.5 + UA-L5).**

---

## 10. STDLIB CHARTER — the 259 GAP-unplanned rows

Three-bucket model ratified (Appendix B); governance = the M4 charter's enforcement half
(UNIFIED-SPEC, stdlib-charter section) gates every new native.

- **Bucket 1 — ADOPT** (≈115 rows): itemized across Waves 3–4 + the triggered module backlog
  (Core.Serde after derive, Core.Event, Core.Cli, Core.Template, Core.Uuid, Caching, Core.Dump).
- **Bucket 2 — EXTENSION story** (≈75 rows: intl/ICU, gd/image, raw sockets, streams zoo, SPL
  decorators, finfo, readline): DESIGN-NEEDED extension policy (vetted-dep forks vs plugin seam vs
  `.d.phg`-PHP-leg-only); until ruled these rows count against parity honestly.
- **Bucket 3 — REJECT with reason** (≈69 rows): procedural aliases, removed/deprecated fns,
  superglobal-mutation APIs, array-cursor family, DWIM linguistics, weak refs, mail() shape —
  carried in Appendix A.

---

## 11. PERCENTAGE LEDGER

### 11.1 Model
M §4 (`docs/research/full-audit/raw/M-gap-matrix.md`): coverage = (COVERED×1 + PARTIAL×0.5) /
(rows − N/A − GAP-by-design), over **824 verdict rows** (173 SYN + 631 FN + 20 RT; net denominator
665 = 129 + 518 + 18). Domain weights 35 SYN / 40 FN-usage-weighted / 25 RT (judgment, always
quoted). Vision = 0.70 × parity + 0.30 × programme. Ratified + recompute-per-milestone rule
(Appendix B).

### 11.2 2026-07-03 re-score — the correction of the stale ≈58%/≈60% (audit B3-7)
The 2026-07-02 baseline missed work shipped since. FN rows flipped, with evidence:

| Group (tier) | Rows flipped | Why | Δ score |
|---|---|---|---|
| FN-HASH (×3) | hash_hmac, hash_equals, hkdf, pbkdf2: GP→COVERED (4 rows) | W3-4 `f4c4c1d` — RFC-KAT'd, byte-identical | +4.0 |
| FN-MATH (×3) | random_int, random_bytes CSPRNG gap →COVERED (2 rows) | `Core.Random.secureInt/secureBytes` shipped (quarantined Tier-B — the model scores capability, quarantine ≠ absent) | +2.0 |
| FN-FS (×3) | parse_ini: GU→COVERED (1 row) | `Core.Ini.parse` shipped `4f4f271`, byte-identical | +1.0 |
| FN-RAND (×2) | engines row: PARTIAL→COVERED | the "no Secure/CSPRNG engine" caveat is gone | +0.5 |

Not moved: NDJSON (no PHP-row counterpart — programme-side only); S0–S2 import redesign
(discipline change, no parity row); W0-2/3/4 (soundness repairs on already-counted rows).

**Arithmetic:** T1 124.5→131.5/303 · T2 18.5→19.0/140 · T3 0/75 ⇒ usage-weighted stdlib
(3×131.5 + 2×19.0)/1264 = 432.5/1264 = **34.2%** (was 32.5%). Parity = 0.35×79.8 + 0.40×34.2 +
0.25×69.4 = 27.9 + 13.7 + 17.4 ≈ **59%**. Programme: M8-crypto 60→70, M-Batteries 50→55
(NDJSON/INI) ⇒ mean 1045/16 = 65.3%. Vision = 0.70×59.0 + 0.30×65.3 ≈ **61%**.

**Grade: [Inferred]** — the flipped rows are Verified-shipped (gate-green commits named); the
figure is a targeted delta on the ratified model, not a full 824-row re-pass. A full re-pass is
due at the next milestone close (recompute rule). Raw row-parity floor moves to ≈39%.

### 11.3 Projected per-wave gains (unchanged model, re-based)

| After | What moves | Parity | Vision |
|---|---|---|---|
| baseline (2026-07-03) | — | **≈59%** | **≈61%** |
| UA programme + W0/W1 | correctness/hygiene — few surface rows | ≈59% | ≈62% |
| W2 | soundness/enforcement SYN rows | ≈60% | ≈63% |
| W3 | DB + HTTP + sessions + format + FS + url | **≈65–66%** | ≈69% |
| W4 | named-args/generators/magic + M-text + date + blitz | **≈71–72%** | ≈75% |
| W5 | beyond-PHP (parity barely moves; programme jumps) | ≈72% | ≈79% |
| W6 | RT/ecosystem rows | **≈75%** | **≈81%** |

[Speculative — model-based projections; re-run real arithmetic per wave.] Residual to 100%:
extension-tier stdlib (§10 Bucket 2, pending the extension-policy ruling), GAP-by-design rows
(excluded by the model), post-1.0 editions.

---

## 12. DELIVERY ORDER (ROI-first — developer-agreed 2026-07-03, updated by the audit rulings)

1. **Stage D/E of the unification audit** (NOW): this plan + UNIFIED-SPEC + Bucket-3 corrections →
   Stage-E gate re-verify + archive the raw research (B3-12).
2. **UA-0 free wins** (§2.1) — no design risk, immediate dev-speed + front-door payoff.
3. **UA-1 byte-identity fixes** (1.1–1.4, 1.6–1.10) + **UA-1.5 `->` retirement sequence**
   (fresh session) — restores Invariant 1 honesty.
4. **UA-L1 spec + pilot** and **UA-L2 prelude/loader unification** — the two
   fix-the-architecture-before-the-next-wave items. UA-L2 HARD-GATES W3-1/W3-2.
5. **UA-L5 rename wave + UA-L6 additive wave** (corpus churn batched together) — then **W6-8
   editor refresh** becomes unblocked (final surface).
6. **W3-5** (blocker adjudication first) → **W3-1 SQL DBAL + W3-2 HTTP client** (the XL heart;
   pure P0s `Core.Sql`/`Core.Url` first) → **W3-3/6/7/8** finish the spine.
7. **W4-4 Unicode strings** (XL; UA-1.1 already set the direction) → **W4-6 + W4-5** → rest of W4.
8. **UA-L3 ReDoS analyzer + UA-L4 Rc<str> refactor** — slot alongside W4 (independent lanes).
9. W2 polish → W5 beyond-PHP → W6 GA.

Ledger basis: W3 ≈+6, W4 ≈+6 parity points are the big movers (§11.3).

## 13. DECISIONS LOG — 2026-07-03 unification-audit rulings (all developer-ruled, final)

- [2026-07-03] **B2-1a** `String.trim` family: **Unicode-aware trim stays canonical; PHP leg gets a
  matching helper** (Option 2 — reversed from the synthesis rec on W4-4-direction evidence). → UA-1.1
- [2026-07-03] **B2-1b** `String.reverse`: **char-wise both legs; mb-safe PHP helper** (Option 1). → UA-1.2
- [2026-07-03] **B2-1c** empty-separator split → **EXPANDED: native-error checked-exception
  taxonomy spec + 4-native pilot, staged rollout** (not a flag-day rewrite; not a lone fault fix). → UA-L1
- [2026-07-03] **B2-1d** `Hash.pbkdf2`: **widen iteration counter to u64; no artificial u32 ceiling**
  (Option 2 — reversed after the "fake ceiling" challenge; ~7 min at 10M ops/s, not years). → UA-1.3
- [2026-07-03] **B2-2** injected preludes: **unify with the module loader NOW, before W3-1/W3-2.** → UA-L2
- [2026-07-03] **B2-3** `->` retirement: **docs/help first, then parser-reject, then individual
  gate-guided fixes; no bulk sed.** → UA-1.5
- [2026-07-03] **B2-4** empty-Map literal: **extend the List empty-`[]` inference rule to Map**;
  **PLUS `[...]` context-typed for Set** (Set has zero literal syntax today — same mechanism). → UA-1.6
- [2026-07-03] **B2-5** `Hash.hmac`: **returns bytes** (breaking, deliberate — more-correct beats
  PHP-familiar; blast radius verified: 1 example + 1 README line). → UA-1.4. **Standing
  instruction adopted into G-4: default-recommend the more-correct option.**
- [2026-07-03] **B2-6** `Math.clamp(min>max)`: **faults.** → UA-1.7
- [2026-07-03] **B2-7** ReDoS asymmetry: **FULL mitigation — transpile-time static regex-complexity
  analyzer** (not disclosure-only; needs its own design pass). → UA-L3
- [2026-07-03] **B2-8** naming: **ONE rename wave, everything folded** (approved trio + all audit
  candidates; crypto 3-module split KEPT + cross-ref docs). → UA-L5
- [2026-07-03] **B2-9** fault messages: **canonicalize on `"Module.function: message"`** (~40
  strings, differential-gated). → UA-1.8
- [2026-07-03] **B2-10** VM strings: **`Rc<str>`/`Rc<String>` + COW `make_mut`** (full fix, not the
  targeted patch; benchmark-evidenced). → UA-L4
- [2026-07-03] **B2-11** stdlib additive: **one wave, approved + new candidates together.** → UA-L6
- [2026-07-03] **B2-12** import-redesign guide example: **yes, add one + README row.** → UA-1.9
- [2026-07-03] **B2-13** playground `forbid(unsafe_code)`: **try empirically first; recorded
  INVARIANTS exemption only if wasm-bindgen genuinely needs unsafe.** → UA-1.10
- [2026-07-03] **Frozen-specs fork:** **fold all 18 `docs/specs/*.md` into `docs/specs/
  UNIFIED-SPEC.md`; update every CLAUDE.md pointer** to the relevant section. (Re-asked at the
  developer's request after a timeout; final — do not re-litigate.)
- [2026-07-03] Earlier same-day rulings carried from wave0-remainder: **W3-5 = `String.format`,
  `{}`-grammar** (blocker pending, §6) · **dependency amendment rusqlite+rustls** · **SQL-DBAL
  scope (SQLite+Postgres+MySQL sync; Oracle deferred; MongoDB separate LADDER item)** · **strict
  per-type imports / member-imports preferred / functions never bare-importable** · **split gate
  (pre-commit Rust-only, pre-push full oracle)** · **`->` removed entirely (no transition alias)** ·
  **delivery order Option 1 ROI-first**.

- [2026-07-04] **Toolchain-version config (DONE):** the gate's php-oracle path is now a single
  editable knob in `scripts/toolchain.env` (`PHORJ_PHP="${PHORJ_PHP:-…php-8.5.8…}"`, exported
  override still wins); `scripts/git-hooks/pre-push` sources it via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`;
  `CLAUDE.md` + this plan's cursor point at it. Triggered by the stack reload bumping the oracle
  8.5.7→**8.5.8** (8.5.7 removed; `cargo-nextest` also wiped — pre-push has a `cargo test` fallback).
  Rust stays pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml` (not duplicated). "A versions file" = this toolchain
  knob, NOT a project-deps file — `src/manifest.rs` already owns deps (no second source of truth).
- [2026-07-04] **`Core.Dotenv` — full Symfony-style cascade (NEW tracked design item, ruled,
  NOT built):** developer chose the full `.env → .env.local → .env.$APP_ENV → .env.$APP_ENV.local`
  cascade over the recommended simpler `Env.load(path)` (my footgun challenge is recorded; it's the
  developer's language call per §ADJUDICATION). Layers on the EXISTING `Core.Environment`
  (`.get`/`.all`, already impure/oracle-quarantined) — this is the `.env`-file-cascade+parser layer,
  not new env reading. Design-spec must decide: the Symfony `test`-env "`.env.local` silently
  skipped" special case (footgun — keep or drop?), `secret-type` integration (`.env` holds secrets →
  avoid secret-in-logs), and the emitted PHP cascade helper for transpile parity (impure → no
  byte-identical differential example, quarantined like the other ambient natives). Same tier as
  UA-L1..L6 — needs its own design pass before code. → tracked as **UA-L7** (Wave-3 web-spine
  adjacent; sequence with the DB/HTTP web work).

### 13.1 · 2026-07-04 fork-backlog adjudication pass (developer-ruled, interactive — final)

Cleared the entire open-fork backlog so the feature marathon runs without stalls. All six ruled
interactively (AskUserQuestion), each with a verified failing/working program in the question. Also
mirrored into the canonical register (`C-decisions.md` DEC-177…DEC-181).

- [2026-07-04] **§7-OPEN trait → BLESSED (DEC-177).** `trait` is not unadopted — it's fully wired
  (`run≡runvm`≡PHP `trait`/`use`, verified end-to-end). Developer blessed BOTH `trait` AND
  multiple-inheritance as first-class (mirrors PHP's own trait/composition duality). → Appendix A
  ADOPTED; FEATURES `trait` flips to delivered. **No longer an open question.**
- [2026-07-04] **W3-5 blocker → RESOLVED via the Type-System programme (DEC-178).** The
  mixed-type-args blocker is subsumed by expected-type threading in the narrowing programme (below);
  `String.format` args use a closed scalar form, not open `Any`. **Folds in UA-1.6** (Set/Map
  literals) — same expected-type mechanism. → Wave C rides Wave A.
- [2026-07-04] **Type-System Completion programme → Wave A (DEC-179).** Developer chose the LARGEST
  scope: usable union-element collections (`List/Set/Map<A|B>`) + primitive `match` type-patterns +
  primitive exhaustiveness + `is` flow-narrowing + is-refinement + **W5-3 sealed hierarchies**
  (exhaustive class unions too) + faithful transpile (`is_int()`/`match(true)`). Reuses the shipped
  M-RT S4 match/exhaustiveness engine (class/enum) extended to primitives. "No half solutions."
- [2026-07-04] **Error model → HONOR the ratified 3-tier (DEC-180).** Developer probed "how do I know
  which error without catchable faults?" → answered by `Result<T, ErrorEnum>` + exhaustive variant
  match (same engine as Wave A) + typed `try`/`catch`/union-catch (SHIPPED, M-faults Slice 2b, base =
  `implements Error` marker). Ruled: complete Result/throws ergonomics + **AUDIT faulting natives —
  reclassify normal-input failures to Result/throws/`T?`**; faults stay uncatchable (bugs only). NO
  catchable faults (would re-add PHP's bug-swallowing footgun). → Wave B.
- [2026-07-04] **Editors → LSP-first, symmetric, then full-native (DEC-181).** VSCode is itself
  LSP-first (all smarts via `phg lsp`; v0.3.0, all 40 keywords in grammar). PhpStorm gets identical
  features via LSP4IJ→`phg lsp`. Ruled: LSP-first + thin native shells now (run/debug/test + DAP —
  what LSP can't do), THEN full native both editors (rich VSCode ext + native IntelliJ/PSI plugin) as
  a follow-on (unverifiable here → developer tests those builds). **STANDING DoD: every shipped
  feature reaches BOTH editors via `phg lsp` in the same change.**
- [2026-07-04] **UA-1.8 shape confirmed/refined (→ DEC B2-9):** canonical =
  `Module.function: lowercase message`; **PHP-mirroring faults (`division by zero`, …) stay
  byte-exact** (value-kernel parity), sweep scopes to native stdlib strings only.
- [2026-07-04] **W4-10 XML — DEFERRED, not adjudicated.** Needs its own design proposal near Wave 4;
  stays the one recorded-but-open design item. **UA-L2 / UA-1.5 / UA-1.6 re-confirmed as already-ruled**
  (build/execution tasks, not forks).
- [2026-07-04] **Canonical `Core.Result` + `Core.Option` (DEC-182) — Wave B foundation.** Verified they
  were USER-DEFINED per-file (`generic-enums.phg`) = "in the wind"; `Error` marker IS built-in. Developer
  ruled: ship BOTH `Core.Result<T,E>` AND `Core.Option<T>` as **injected, explicitly-imported** canonical
  types (same pattern as injected `Json`: `inject_result_prelude`/`inject_option_prelude` gated on
  `import Core.Result;`/`import Core.Option;` + `module_of` registry entry → qualified `Result.Success`/
  `Option.Some`, bare use = `E-INJECTED-VARIANT-BARE`; ride the shipped `erase_generics`; PHP variant
  classes). **`Option<T>` vs built-in `T?`: DISTINCT roles, explicit conversion, NO implicit coercion** —
  `T?` stays the lightweight built-in absence + what stdlib returns; `Option<T>` is the opt-in rich
  monadic wrapper (map/andThen/filter/getOrElse) imported when you want combinator chains; interconvert
  via `Option.ofNullable(x)`/`opt.toNullable()`. `Error` stays built-in; error payloads (`E`) = user
  enums. + combinator methods + `T?`↔`Option` conversions. → folds into Wave B.
- [2026-07-04] **sprintf/`String.format` CONFIRMED** (developer, re-confirming DEC-178): implement per
  the ruling — `Core.String.format(spec, args)`, `{}`-grammar shared with W5-1 interpolation, closed
  scalar args via Wave A threading. Sequenced in **Wave C** (after Wave A + Wave B). No refinement.

### 13.2 · Wave A slice-2 adjudications (surfaced + ruled 2026-07-04)

Surfaced per §15 (a genuine fork, don't self-rule) during the marathon; **ruled interactively by the
developer** (AskUserQuestion, minimal failing program in the question). Register: DEC-183.

- **[2026-07-04] RULED Option A (DEC-183) — flat wildcard-free `match` over `T?` IS exhaustive.**
  Built + shipped as slice 2b (`51c580e`, full gate 1684 green): `Optional<T>` treated as `T | null` for match totality — member arms + a `null`
  arm discharge it, no `_`. Bounded caveat kept: `Optional<enum>` still needs `_` (enum-variant
  coverage not threaded through `?` — follow-up). Original fork write-up (for the record):

  Wave A
  slice 2 verified that union-element collection methods are *already consumable*: `.filter` keeps
  `List<A|B>`, `.map` returns `List<U>`, and `.first()`→`(A|B)?` is consumed via a `null` arm +
  smart-cast, OR a `_` catch-all (both type-check + run byte-identical today — see
  `examples/guide/union-collections.phg`). What does NOT work is a flat, wildcard-free exhaustive
  match that reads `T?` as `T | null` and is discharged by the member arms + a `null` arm:

      List<int | string> xs = [1, "two"];
      var h = xs.first();                            // h : (int | string)?
      match (h) { int i => .., string s => .., null => .. }
      // → type error: "non-exhaustive match: add a `_` wildcard arm for non-enum scrutinees"

  This is a genuine fork (≥2 defensible designs), NOT a mechanical extension of slice 1: it changes
  match exhaustiveness for EVERY `T?` scrutinee (`int?`, `Circle?`, `(A|B)?`), not just union-element
  results. Slice-1's "null is discriminable" justifies `null` as a *pattern*; it does not rule that
  `Optional` *scrutinees* get union-style exhaustiveness — that is a separate ruling.
  - **Option A (recommended) — enable it: treat `Optional<T>` as `T | null` for match
    exhaustiveness.** A flat `match opt { <members of T>, null }` becomes total; no `_` needed.
    Consistent with slice 1 (null already in the discriminable set) and with the "usable
    union-element collections" scope of DEC-179; byte-identity holds (pattern-driven `is_int`/
    `is_null`, verified). Bounded caveat to also surface: an `Optional<enum>` (`Color?`) would still
    need `_` unless enum-variant coverage is separately threaded through `Optional`. **Why first:**
    it is the natural completion of slice 1 and makes `.first`/`.last`/`Map.get` results ergonomic
    without forcing a smart-cast.
  - **Option B — keep requiring `_`/smart-cast.** `T?` stays non-exhaustive-matchable; consume via
    the already-working `null`-arm smart-cast or a `_`. Smaller surface / one obvious way, but the
    flat form many will reach for stays a compile error.

  Until ruled: NO code shipped for either option; the consumable forms above already work. The
  byte-identity guard hole this slice found on the same path (`(string | decimal)?` matched by
  `string` bypassing `E-MATCH-ERASED-AMBIG`) was a G-1 correctness bug, NOT a fork — fixed this slice.

- **[2026-07-04] RULED full symmetry (DEC-184) — type-test operator `is` + `instanceof` (slice 3).**
  Two ratified docs disagreed (DEC-179 `is` flow-narrowing vs UNIFIED-SPEC `is`=identity; neither
  implemented, identity deferred). Surfaced as a §15 adjudication; recommended `is`-universal +
  `instanceof`-class-only (challenged the developer on TIMTOWTDI + `instanceof int` lacking PHP
  precedent). **Developer ruled FULL SYMMETRY:** both `is` and `instanceof` test/narrow over
  primitives AND classes, interchangeably (`x is int` ≡ `x instanceof int`, `x is Circle` ≡
  `x instanceof Circle`); both flow-narrow in `if` branches. Discriminable set + `string`-over-erased
  byte-identity guard mirror `match` (slice 1). `is`=identity spec line SUPERSEDED (→ named stdlib
  form later if ever needed). Building as slice 3.
- **[2026-07-04] STILL-OPEN scope note (not a fork — tracked build work): `Map`/`Set<A|B>` literal
  construction.** DEC-179 scopes Wave A as "usable union-element collections (`List`/**`Set`/`Map`**
  `<A|B>`)". Slice 2 closes **`List` method consumption only**. `Map<string, int | string> m =
  ["a" => 1, "b" => "two"]` still errors (`map values must share one type; found int and string`) —
  the value-union isn't threaded into the literal. This is the **expected-type-threading** axis
  already tracked under DEC-178 / UA-1.6 (the same mechanism that unblocks W3-5); it is NOT closed by
  slice 2 and is NOT a new fork — build it on that axis. Kept visible here so "usable Set/Map`<A|B>`"
  isn't mistaken as delivered.

## APPENDICES

### Appendix A — REJECTED items (no silent scope drops)

Carried unchanged from the 2026-07-02 plan (full row IDs in the M/F/C raw reports):
- **A.1** M's 49 GAP-by-design rows (eval/include/shell-exec, variable-variables, references,
  `@` suppression, goto, fall-through, runtime magic methods, isset/empty truthiness, locale-
  sensitive core, mutable DateTime/strtotime, pcntl, ini/error-handler config, ICU collator tier,
  func_get_args/class_exists, dynamic .so model).
- **A.2** F's 26 cross-language rejects (colored async, open macros, comptime, decorators, operator
  overloading, extension functions, scope functions, cascades, **comprehensions** (ruled, stands),
  LINQ, implicit `it`, structural records, refinement/linear types, HKT, variance annotations,
  const generics, GADTs, units, guaranteed TCO, method_missing, implicits, do-notation, chained
  comparisons, hot reload) + **FFI** (`.d.phg` is the seam) + **shared run/VM IR** (ADR-0001).
- **A.3** Register rejects (single-quote strings, `<=>`, `.` concat, ambient superglobals, loose
  `==`, PL-theory vanity set).
- **A.4** Stdlib Bucket-3 (≈69 rows, §10).
- **A.5** (2026-07-03) **TypeScript utility types REJECTED** (Partial/Pick/Omit/etc. — structural
  type-level programming alien to the nominal/PHP model; escape hatch: a native patch construct
  only on real pain evidence).
