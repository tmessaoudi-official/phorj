# Overnight Autonomous Session — 2026-06-25

> Autonomous build run started 2026-06-25 (developer asleep). Resumes/continues the
> `2026-06-24-language-evolution-master.plan.md` sequence, then pushes into the next roadmap milestone.
> Companion: `2026-06-25-overnight-design-forks-review.plan.md` (every genuine fork logged for morning review).

## Decisions Log
- [2026-06-25] AGREED: **Scope** = finish the entire language-evolution master plan
  (Slice 6 UFCS → Slice 7 Text natives → Phase 2 Core.Reflect + Process I/O), THEN pull the next
  roadmap milestone (likely M4 stdlib charter / M-text) and keep shipping until morning.
- [2026-06-25] AGREED: **Design forks** = best-judgment + document; NEVER decide silently. Each genuine
  fork → logged to the design-forks review plan with options + provisional call + rationale, flagged
  `⏳ AWAITING CONFIRMATION`. Work never blocks; nothing is lost.
- [2026-06-25] AGREED: **Git** = autonomous `add`/`commit` of green, fully-gated, self-contained slices.
  **NO push** — master stays local for the developer to review in the morning.
- [2026-06-25] AGREED: **Gate** = fully autonomous (suppress confirmation gates; risky/destructive still
  pause) + maximum rigor. Every commit must pass `cargo test --workspace` + `cargo clippy --all-targets`
  + `cargo fmt --check` + the PHP-8.5 oracle (`PHORGE_PHP=/stack/tools/phpbrew/php/php-8.5.7/bin/php
  PHORGE_REQUIRE_PHP=1`). A convergence pass runs per slice (design before, result after).
- [2026-06-25] AGREED: **Per-feature deliverable** (standing project rule [[examples-ship-with-features]]):
  every shipped feature lands with a runnable `examples/guide/*.phg` (byte-identity-gated) + an
  `examples/README.md` entry, in the same commit as the feature.

## Baseline
- HEAD at start: `e8319ff` (test(lang): regression guard for chained opt! on object optionals).
- Tree clean; full workspace + PHP-8.5 oracle gate green (exit 0) verified before any work.
- Toolchain: `export PATH=/stack/tools/cargo/bin:$PATH`; cargo 1.96.0; PHP 8.5.7 floor present.

## Work sequence (live status)

### Phase 1 (finish ergonomics perimeter)
- [ ] **Slice 6 — UFCS** `x.f(a) ≡ f(x, a)`, general, **method-first** resolution (real method on x's
  type wins; else free-function fallback). Enables `xs.length()`, `xs.filter(p).map(g)`.
  Guide: `examples/guide/ufcs.phg`.
- [ ] **Slice 7 — Text natives** `Text.charAt` / `Text.substring` (safe alternative to `s[0]`).

### Phase 2 (introspection + process)
- [ ] **Core.Reflect** — `typeName`/`className`/`implements`/`parents`/`traits`/`methodNames`/`fieldNames`
  via `NativeEval::Reflective(fn(&[Value], &ClassTables))`. No new `Op`. Read-only, name-level.
- [ ] **Process I/O** — `Core.Process.args()`, `Core.Env.get/all` on a quarantine seam (impure-native,
  excluded from `differential.rs`; README walkthrough, not a gated example). CLI `phg run f.phg -- args`.
- [ ] **Superglobal map** — docs/routing only (no new mechanism).

### Beyond the plan (if time remains before morning)
- [ ] Next roadmap milestone — re-read `ROADMAP.md` / `docs/MILESTONES.md` at that point, pick the
  highest needle-mover that's autonomous-safe (design largely resolved), log the choice here.

## Progress log
- [2026-06-25 start] Plan files created; baseline green; beginning Slice 6 (UFCS).
- [2026-06-25] **Slice 6 (UFCS) implemented.** `x.f(a)` ≡ `f(x, a)`, method-first; fallback to a user
  free function or any *imported* `Core.*` native whose first param accepts the receiver (by-`unify`
  selection — F-001). Type-directed post-check rewrite (`checker::rewrite_ufcs`, span-keyed like
  `resolve_html`), wired last in `check_and_expand`; **no new `Op`/`Value`**. New code `E-UFCS-AMBIGUOUS`.
  **Root-cause fix (uncovered building this):** interpolation sub-expression `span.start` values were
  segment-relative (a fresh sub-lexer restarts at 0) → span-keyed rewrites collided inside `"{…}"`.
  Fixed by threading the interpolation content's absolute byte offset through `StrSeg::Interp(String,
  usize)` and offsetting re-lexed token `start`s in the parser (line/col untouched, so diagnostics are
  unchanged). `examples/guide/ufcs.phg` byte-identical run≡runvm≡real PHP 8.5; 7 new checker unit tests;
  README entry added. Full gate running. Forks F-001..F-004 logged for morning review.
