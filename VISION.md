# Vision

## The one-sentence version

**Phorj is what PHP might feel like if it were designed today: the same approachable, get-things-done
ergonomics, rebuilt on a statically-typed, immutable-by-default, compiler-checked foundation.**

## Why Phorj exists

PHP made web programming accessible to a generation of developers. Its syntax is familiar, its
feedback loop is short, and it gets out of your way. But it carries decades of dynamic-typing
baggage: errors that only surface at runtime, a type system bolted on after the fact, and surprising
coercions.

Phorj keeps what makes that style of language *pleasant* — readable syntax, string interpolation,
classes, a tiny path from "idea" to "running program" — and puts it on a foundation that catches
mistakes **before** the program runs:

- **Static types, checked up front.** If it type-checks, whole classes of runtime errors are gone.
- **Immutable by default.** State you can reason about. Mutation is opt-in, not the default.
- **No surprises.** Integer overflow and division-by-zero are clean errors, never silent wraparound
  or a crash. Malformed input never panics the toolchain.
- **One language, several targets.** The same program runs on a tree-walking interpreter, a bytecode
  VM, transpiles to real PHP, or compiles to a single standalone native binary — all producing
  identical results.

## The philosophy

PHP is Phorj's **starting point — the floor, not the ceiling and not the identity.** Phorj inherits
PHP's approachability and its concepts, then is bound only by two things: **software craftsmanship and
effort.**

- **Craftsmanship is the standard everything is measured against.** Anything in PHP that violates
  best practice, SOLID, or sound design patterns *changes*; anything that respects them *stays*.
  Familiarity never excuses a compromise — if a PHP idiom encourages something unsound, Phorj changes
  it, syntax included.
- **Familiarity is in what the language *does*** — the concepts and mental model an experienced PHP
  developer already carries — and only *lightly* in syntax. The goal is recognition, not replication.
- **The PHP transpile is a migration bridge, both ways.** Phorj → PHP lets you deploy and adopt
  incrementally; the planned PHP → Phorj importer lets existing codebases move onto a typed
  foundation. The bridge lowers the on-ramp; it does not cap the language.
- **No ceiling.** The only limit on how good, how capable, how fast, and how easy-to-learn Phorj
  becomes is the effort invested. PHP is where it begins, not where it ends.
- **Power is additive — coexistence, not replacement.** New capabilities are added *alongside*
  existing strengths, never by removing them: traits and class inheritance both earn their place;
  overloading arrives without displacing nullable or variadic parameters. Each feature is interrogated
  for how it interacts with the rest and what it must enforce to stay sound.

## Design principles

1. **Correctness is the spine.** Every backend must produce byte-identical output to the reference
   interpreter, enforced by differential testing. A feature that can't be proven equivalent across
   backends doesn't ship.
2. **No silent failure.** The toolchain rejects bad input with a diagnostic, never a panic, hang, or
   out-of-bounds read — including when parsing untrusted binaries.
3. **Earn complexity.** Abstractions (a pluggable backend trait, a tracing GC, an arena allocator)
   are added when a third use case demands them, not speculatively. The Rule of Three is a design
   tool, not a slogan.
4. **Std-first core with a minimal, vetted dependency surface.** Exactly four feature-gated
   external crates (`argon2`, `regex`, `ctrlc`, `corosensei`), each admitted only where rolling our
   own would be the anti-pattern (see `docs/specs/UNIFIED-SPEC.md#external-dependency-policy`). The whole
   language fits in one head, builds in seconds, and keeps the supply-chain surface deliberately tiny.
5. **Approachable on the outside, rigorous on the inside.** A beginner should be able to read a Phorj
   program; a compiler engineer should respect how it's built.

## Where this is going

The near-term arc is concrete and already underway (see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)): a complete language
core (✅), a fast VM (✅), single-binary distribution across operating systems (🔨), and language
enrichment — indexing, collections, optionals, pipes, exceptions, and mutation (✅ — value/handle
split + copy-on-write; a tracing GC stays deliberately deferred to v2).

The longer-term ambition is an **ecosystem**, not just a language — and much of it has already
landed: a growing standard library, real modules and packages (✅), first-class concurrency
(uncolored `spawn` + channels, ✅) and a native HTTP server (✅), proper tooling (LSP, formatter,
debugger — ✅), and — closing the loop with its PHP heritage — a **PHP → Phorj migration tool**
(`phg lift`, ✅) that lets existing codebases move onto a typed foundation incrementally.

The furthest horizon (v2) pushes toward systems programming: native ahead-of-time compilation, an
ownership model that removes the GC, and sized-integer performance.

## What Phorj is not

- It is **not** a PHP runtime or a drop-in PHP replacement. It *transpiles to* PHP and aims to
  eventually *import from* it, but Phorj is its own statically-typed language.
- It is **not** trying to be everything at once. The roadmap is deliberate and ordered; "planned"
  features are planned on purpose, not missing by accident.
