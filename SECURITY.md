# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Phorj is pre-1.0 and developed by a single maintainer. Only the latest tagged release and the
`master` branch receive fixes.

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| latest stable (`v*`) release / `master` | ✅ |
| `nightly` (rolling prerelease from `master`) | ✅ — fixed by the next master push |
| older tags | ❌ |

(Channels: `nightly` = rolling prerelease rebuilt on every master push; `stable` = `v*` tags — see
[`SEMVER.md`](SEMVER.md) §Release channels. No LTS pre-1.0.)

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report privately through GitHub's **[private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)**
on the repository (Security → Report a vulnerability), or contact the maintainer through their GitHub
profile: **[@tmessaoudi-official](https://github.com/tmessaoudi-official)**.

Please include: a description of the issue, steps to reproduce (a minimal `.phg` program or input is
ideal), the affected version/commit, and the impact you observed. You can expect an initial
acknowledgement within a reasonable time; fixes are coordinated before public disclosure.

## Threat model & hardening notes

Phorj is a language toolchain, so the relevant attack surface is **untrusted input**:

- **Untrusted source programs.** The lexer, parser, and type-checker must reject malformed or
  adversarial programs cleanly (a diagnostic + non-zero exit), never with a panic, infinite loop, or
  unbounded memory growth. Recursion and nesting are explicitly depth-limited (`src/limits.rs`) on a
  fixed-size worker stack so pathological nesting faults cleanly.
- **Untrusted binaries (`phg build`).** The hand-rolled ELF / PE / Mach-O section readers used to
  detect an embedded program parse attacker-controlled object files. They perform **minimal section
  lookup with checked arithmetic on every offset** — malformed or hostile headers return `None`, never
  an overflow panic or out-of-bounds read (invariant **EV-7**). `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` is set
  crate-wide.
- **No third-party runtime dependencies.** Phorj links zero external crates, which removes the
  supply-chain surface for the runtime (see [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md)).
- **`phg vendor` (supply chain).** This is the only command that touches the network, and it runs
  only on an explicit `phg vendor`. A dependency's `git`/`tag`/`rev` is passed to `git` behind a `--`
  end-of-options separator with `protocol.ext.allow=never`, and rejected if it would be read as a git
  option (leading `-`) or a command-executing remote helper (`ext::`/`file::`). A dependency `name`
  and the `source` root are validated at manifest-parse time (no `..` traversal, no absolute paths) so
  they cannot escape the project / `vendor/` tree. `run`/`check`/`transpile` never fetch — they resolve
  offline from the committed `vendor/`.
- **`phg serve` (HTTP runtime).** The server is **single-threaded by design** (the `Rc`-shared value
  heap is not `Send`), so it handles one connection at a time. It is resilient — a per-connection read
  or send error, a request fault (→ 500), or a slow/idle client (bounded by `--timeout`, default 30s)
  never ends the server; only a persistently failing listener does. **Bind `127.0.0.1` (the default)
  on untrusted networks** and keep `--timeout` set. Note: the request body is capped (8 MiB) but the
  `Core.File` natives a handler may call do **no path sandboxing** — a served program that opens
  caller-influenced paths can read/write any file the server process can. Treat a `phg serve` program
  as you would any unsandboxed web app.

If you find input that causes a panic, crash, hang, or unbounded resource use, that is a bug we want
to hear about — please report it as above.
